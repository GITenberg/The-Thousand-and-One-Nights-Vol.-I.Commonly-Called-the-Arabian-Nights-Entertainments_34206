<h4>ADVERTISEMENT.</h4>

<p>The present edition is an exact reproduction of that edited by my
father, with my great-uncle's final corrections, and published by Mr.
John Murray in 1859. Several reprints of that edition have testified
to the continued popularity of the work, and the necessity for the
present issue shows that an acquaintance of nearly half a century has
not yet wearied the public of the standard translation of the <i>Thousand
and One Nights</i>. The secret of Mr. Lane's success is to be found
partly in the instinctive sympathy for the spirit of the East, which
enabled him faithfully to reproduce the characteristic tone of the
original, and partly in the rich store of illustrations of oriental life
and thought contained in his Notes. In the various cheap versions,
based upon Galland's French paraphrase, the Eastern tone and local
colour is wholly wanting; and the peculiarities of life and manners,
which contrast so markedly with those of the West, are left unnoted
and unexplained. Such versions may serve in an inadequate degree
to make the Arabian Nights known to those who care only for the
bare stories; but educated readers, who are capable of something
more than the mere enjoyment of the romance, and desire to understand
the character and habits of the actors and the spectators, find
in Mr. Lane's translation, and in his only, a complete satisfaction of
their want. It is not merely a scholar's edition, though no oriental
student can afford to be without it; but beyond this narrow circle it
has ever appealed to the wide audience that cares to know the famous
books of the world in their most perfect and faithful reflections.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span></p><p>The actual moment is an opportune one for the reappearance of
the work. Egypt just now holds a foremost place in the eyes of
the world, and it is of Egypt that the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>
have most to tell. Indian or Persian as many of the tales are in
their origin, their setting is almost purely Egyptian; and though the
place may be nominally Baghdad or India, or even furthest China, it is
in medi&aelig;val Cairo, in the days of the Memlooks, that the scene of the
Arabian Nights is really laid. The people described are not Hindoos
or Chinese, but Arabs and Egyptians as they lived and moved in the
fifteenth century, when some of the beautiful mosques and tombs,
that still make Cairo the delight of artists, were being built, and the
devastating hand of the Ottoman Turk had not yet been laid on the
land of the Pharaohs. For a minute picture of Arabian society as
it was in the Middle Ages, the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i> have no
rival, and it is Mr. Lane's appreciation of this picture, and the wealth
of illustration lavished upon it in his Notes, that render his edition the
most complete commentary we possess on Muslim life and manners,
religion and literature, and make it an indispensable supplement to his
famous <i>Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians</i>.
The poetry of Eastern life is rapidly fading away under the effacing
touch of European civilisation; the characteristic society in which an
Haroon-Er-Rasheed, an Aboo-Nuwas, a Kafoor, a Saladin, or a Ka&iuml;t-Bey,
revelled and jested and conquered, is fast becoming matter of
history rather than of experience, a field for the antiquary instead of
the traveller; and it is well that we can reconstruct it in the pages of
the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>, whose compiler saw it when it was
still almost in its Golden Prime, and in the <i>Modern Egyptians</i>, whose
author knew it when it still preserved the romantic character which
has charmed and fascinated readers of every age and condition.</p>

<h4>THE EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h4>

<p>A new edition of this work having been required, Mr. Lane
was requested to undertake the correction of the press. But severe
literary labours allowing him no leisure for this object, he named
me, as his pupil in the study of Arabic, familiar with his writings,
and for many years resident with him in Cairo, to fill, in some
measure, his place. I have undertaken this duty with great diffidence,
from a sense of my own deficiencies and his extensive
knowledge; but I have felt that I could at least insure the correctness
of the text, and a scrupulous adherence to his wishes.
The present edition is printed, without any variations of my own
(except those which are marked as such, and have been submitted
to Mr. Lane), from a copy of the first and complete edition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
with corrections and additions made by Mr. Lane, from time to
time, since its first publication. These, however, from the accuracy
with which the translation was made, and the fulness of the Notes,
are not very numerous. The same reasons have also caused my
own notes to be few: I believe that my Uncle's notes are complete
in themselves; and that I have sometimes erred, even in the rare
exceptions I have made, on the side of unnecessary addition.</p>

<p>An edition of any book not superintended by the author is
sometimes regarded with distrust. I would therefore assure the
reader that in this instance he may depend even on the punctuation;
the whole having been laboriously collated with Mr. Lane's
annotated copy, notwithstanding the great delay which this process
has occasioned in the printing of the work.</p>

<p>I have called this a <i>complete</i> edition, to distinguish it from two
others which have been published without Mr. Lane's notes or his
method of writing oriental words, and with other variations from
the standard edition. The public appreciation of these notes, and
of the advantage of correctly-written foreign words, is, I conceive,
proved by the call for the present edition. On the subject of
the mode of writing oriental words in European characters, I need
say little, for the controversy has well nigh died out. The present
generation does not regard antiquated blunders as "the familiar
names of childhood," but rather strives to attain accuracy in all
things; and those few who still cling to "Mahomet" or "Mahomed"
should consistently exhume the forgotten "Mahound" of
the Crusades.</p>

<p>The translator's views respecting the origin and literary history
of "The Thousand and One Nights" will be found fully expressed in
the Review at the end of the third volume. In his original preface,
he stated, "The remarks which I here submit to the reader, being
written when only one-third of the work to which they principally
relate is printed, must unavoidably be more defective than they
would be if reserved until a later period. During the progress of
the publication I may be enabled to form clearer and more complete
views of the several subjects which might with propriety be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
fully discussed at the head of my translation, and I think it better,
therefore, to append at the close of the work many observations
which I originally intended to prefix to the first volume." He has
therefore wished me to remodel the preface, transferring all portions
relating to the subjects in question to the Review, retaining whatever
may more properly stand at the commencement of the work,
and adding any matter of my own.</p>

<p>The object with which the translation was made is best expressed
in the words of Mr. Lane's preface.</p>

<p>"My undertaking to translate anew the Tales of 'The Thousand
and One Nights' implies an unfavourable opinion of the version
which has so long amused us; but I must express my objections
with respect to the latter in plain terms, and this I shall do by
means of a few words on the version of Galland, from which it is
derived; for to him alone its chief faults are to be attributed.
I am somewhat reluctant to make this remark, because several
persons, and among them some of high and deserved reputation as
Arabic scholars, have pronounced an opinion that his version is an
<i>improvement</i> upon the original. That 'The Thousand and One
Nights' may be greatly improved, I most readily admit; but as
confidently do I assert that Galland has excessively <i>perverted</i> the
work. His acquaintance with Arab manners and customs was
insufficient to preserve him always from errors of the grossest
description, and by the <i>style</i> of his version he has given to the
whole a false character, thus sacrificing, in a great measure, what
is most valuable in the original work,&mdash;I mean its minute accuracy
with respect to those peculiarities which distinguish the Arabs from
every other nation, not only of the West, but also of the East.
Deceived by the vague nature of Galland's version, travellers in
Persia, Turkey, and India, have often fancied that the Arabian
Tales describe the particular manners of the natives of those
countries; but no one who has read them in the original language,
having an intimate acquaintance with the Arabs, can be of this
opinion: it is in Arabian countries, and especially in Egypt, that
we see the people, the dresses, and the buildings, which it describes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
in almost every case, even when the scene is laid in Persia, in
India, or in China.</p>

<p>"Convinced of the truth of this assertion, I consider myself
possessed of the chief qualifications for the proper accomplishment
of my present undertaking, from my having lived several years in
Cairo, associating almost exclusively with Arabs, speaking their
language, conforming to their general habits with the most scrupulous
exactitude, and received into their society on terms of
perfect equality. Since the downfall of the Arab Empire of
Baghd&aacute;d, Cairo has been the chief of Arabian cities: its Memlook
Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns, introduced into Egypt in their youth, naturally adopted,
to a great degree, the manners of its native inhabitants, which the
'Osm&aacute;nlee Turks in later days have but little altered. Cairo is
the city in which Arabian manners now exist in the most refined
state; and such I believe to have been the case when the present
work was composed."</p>

<p>Mr. Lane's first two visits to Egypt were made when, for the
last time, Arab manners and customs as they existed in the age of
the Arabian Nights could be studied; and his translation was written
very shortly after his second return to England. Though some of
the tales maybe Indian or Persian in origin, in their present state
they exhibit a picture of the manners, modes of thought, and language,
of the court and times of the Memlook Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns of Egypt,
which nearly resembled in these points those of the Khaleefehs of
Baghd&aacute;d, or the great Arab Empire. De Sacy and Von Hammer,
the two celebrated orientalists who differed widely in opinion as to
the origin of the book, agreed that the tales in which the Khaleefeh
H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed is introduced (the best, with few exceptions,
in the collection) are Egyptian in character. But since the
"Modern Egyptians" were described by Mr. Lane, all things
in the East have changed, and every day witnesses the decay of
some old custom, to be followed by a bastard European imitation.
During Mohammad 'Alee's rule, all traces of the state and circumstance
of the Memlook court gradually passed away. European
dress has displaced oriental costume, cloth of gold, and dresses of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
honour; European architecture elbows the quaint beauty of the old
Arab capital; and the cavalcade of fifty horsemen around a grandee
is succeeded by an English carriage that profanes the quiet streets
of the city, and frightens away both 'Efreets and their memory.
Mr. Lane saw the last of Cairo in its integrity; and he has not
overstated his qualifications, as author of the "Modern Egyptians,"
for the task of translating the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>Of the copy from which this translation was made, and the
method observed in its execution, I may again quote the preface
to the first edition. Mr. Lane says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have taken as my general standard of the original text the
Cairo edition lately printed; it being greatly superior to the other
printed editions, and probably to every manuscript copy.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It
appears to agree almost exactly with the celebrated MS. of Von
Hammer, than which no copy more copious, I believe, exists; and
contains all the tales in the old version except those which, as
Von Hammer says, Galland appears to have taken from other
works, Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, in the Royal Library of Paris.
The manuscript from which it was printed was carefully collated
and corrected by a very learned man, the sheykh 'Abd-Er-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n
E&#7779;-&#7778;aftee Esh-Shar&#7731;&aacute;wee, who also superintended the progress of
the work through the press. But in addition to the value conferred
upon it by the corrections of this sheykh, the copy from
which the whole of my translation is made, except in a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>instances, possesses an advantage which, I believe, renders it
incomparably superior to any other now existing: it has been
again revised and corrected, and illustrated with numerous manuscript
notes, by a person whom I think I may safely pronounce
the first philologist of the first Arab college of the present day,
the sheykh Mo&#7717;ammad 'Eiy&aacute;d E&#7789;-&#7788;an&#7789;&aacute;wee, or, more properly,
E&#7789;-&#7788;andit&aacute;ee. His notes are chiefly philological, and explanatory
of words which do not belong to the classical language; and many
of them are of very great assistance to me; though most of them
I find unnecessary, from the knowledge of the modern Arabic
which I have acquired during my intercourse with the people who
speak it. His corrections of the text are numerous; and as they
would interest very few persons, I have mentioned but few of them
in the notes to my translation, notwithstanding a strong temptation
that I felt to do otherwise in order that Arabic scholars might be
assisted to judge of the fidelity of my version by comparing it with
the text of the Cairo edition.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> To the pieces of poetry which are
interspersed throughout the work he has paid especial attention;
not only correcting the errors which he found in them, but also
always adding the vowel-points, and generally, commentaries or
explanations. Thus I have shewn that I am very greatly indebted
to him for his learned labours. I should, however, add, that I have
ventured to differ from him in interpreting a few words; having
found more appropriate meanings assigned to them by Arabs in
parts not visited by him, or such meanings given in printed dictionaries
with which he is unacquainted; and I have also corrected
a few errors which have escaped his notice.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Without the valuable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>aid which he has afforded me, I would not have attempted the
translation; nor with it would I have done so were it not for the
advantage that I derive from my having lived among Arabs. No
translator can always be certain that, from twenty or more significations
which are borne by one Arabic word, he has selected that
which his author intended to convey; but, circumstanced as I am,
I have the satisfaction of feeling confident that I have never given,
to a word or phrase in this work, a meaning which is inconsistent
with its presenting faithful pictures of Arab life and manners.</p>

<p>"I have thought it right to omit such tales, anecdotes, &amp;c., as
are comparatively uninteresting or on any account objectionable.
In other words, I insert nothing that I deem greatly inferior in
interest to the tales in the old version. Certain passages which, in
the original work, are of an objectionable nature, I have slightly
varied; but in doing this, I have been particularly careful to render
them so as to be perfectly agreeable with Arab manners and
customs. It was originally my intention to omit almost the whole
of the poetry, thinking that the loss of measure and rhyme, and
the impossibility of preserving the examples of paronomasia and
some other figures with which they abound, would render translations
of them generally intolerable to the reader: but afterwards I
reflected that the character of the work would be thus greatly
altered; and its value, as illustrating Arab manners and feelings,
much diminished. I therefore determined to preserve a considerable
number of select pieces, chosen either for their relative
merits or because required by the context. The number of those
comprised in the first volume of my translation is nearly half
of the number contained in the corresponding portion of the
original work; but in several cases I have omitted one or more
verses of a piece as unsuitable, or for some other reason; and
in a few instances I have given only the first verse or the first
couplet. These pieces of poetry are not in general to be regarded
as the compositions of the author or authors of the work: they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
appear to be mostly borrowed from others, and many of them are
taken from the works of celebrated poets.&mdash;To avoid the tedious
interruptions which occur in the original at the close of each
Night, I have divided the translation into chapters, each of which
consists of one tale, or of two or more tales connected one with
another, and have merely mentioned the Night with which each
chapter commences, and that with which it terminates.</p>

<p>"The original work being designed solely for the entertainment
of Arabs, I add copious notes to the translation, to render it more
intelligible and agreeable to the English reader. These are entirely
my own, except in those cases when I have stated otherwise;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
and my general object in them has been to give such illustrations
as may satisfy the general reader, without obliging him to consult
other works. In many of them I endeavour to shew, by extracts
from esteemed Arabic histories and scientific and other writings,
chiefly drawn from MSS. in my possession, as well as by assertions
and anecdotes that I have heard, and conduct that I have witnessed,
during my intercourse with Arabs, that the most extravagant
relations in this work are not in general regarded, even by the
educated classes of that people, as of an incredible nature. This
is a point which I deem of much importance to set the work in its
proper light before my countrymen. I have resided in a land
where genii are still firmly believed to obey the summons of the
magician or the owner of a talisman, and to act in occurrences of
every day; and I have listened to stories of their deeds related as
facts by persons of the highest respectability, and by some who
would not condescend to read the tales of 'The Thousand and
One Nights,' merely because they are fictions, and not written
in the usual polished style of literary compositions."</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the literary history of "The
Thousand and One Nights" is discussed in Mr. Lane's Review
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>appended to this translation. In the course of my Arabic studies,
and more especially since I have been occupied in editing the
present work, I have endeavoured to form an unbiassed judgment
on this difficult question; and all my researches have confirmed
me in agreeing with the opinions there expressed. Von
Hammer was inclined to lay too much stress on the supposed
Persian or Indian origin of these Tales; while De Sacy, on the
other hand, rejected the belief in any connection between the old
work and the more modern; contending that the latter was an
independent production. The discovery, however, of a passage in
an Arabic author, by Von Hammer, since the publication of
De Sacy's Essay and Mr. Lane's Preface, has placed the matter
beyond a doubt; and scholars are now agreed, notwithstanding
De Sacy's pleasant sarcasm, and the weight of his great name,
that "The Thousand Nights" formed in some measure the
prototype of "The Thousand and One Nights." On the other
hand, De Sacy's keen appreciation of the modern (and chiefly
Egyptian, or Arab,) character of the book, in its present form,
must be fully recognised, and was indeed thus acknowledged by
Von Hammer himself. The manners, dresses, and modes of
thought, portrayed by it are Arab throughout, even in the stories
which are probably retained from the Persian or Indian original, of
which that of the Magic Horse is the best example in this
translation. Besides those relating to the court and adventures
of H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed, which, as I have before remarked, are
curiously Egyptian, many others appear to have been remodelled,
if not actually composed, in Egypt. It is not less true that
these tales are generally the best in the collection, if those of
the Slave K&aacute;foor, of 'Azeez and 'Azeezeh, and of Es-Sindib&aacute;d, be
excepted; for these certainly are inferior to none. The more
colloquial and familiar stories point to the same origin; such as
that of 'Al&aacute;-ed-Deen Abu-sh-Sh&aacute;m&aacute;t (which is pervaded by
Egyptian characteristics in phraseology and in other respects),
that of Aboo-&#7778;eer and Aboo-&#7730;eer, and that of Ma&#7841;roof. The
stories founded mainly on Persian or Indian originals appear to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
those in which supernatural beings play the most conspicuous
parts; and, as Mr. Lane remarks, these are generally deficient in
verses, although the converse does not hold good of the former
class. The anecdotes are mostly historical: many of them are, in
the Notes, identified with similar ones in other Arabic works; and
almost all are of Arab origin.</p>

<p>The evidences of a late date scattered through the book may
be additions of copyists and reciters; but considered with reference
to its general character, they have a certain weight that cannot be
overlooked: this is carefully stated in the Review.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane's arguments in favour of the collective "Thousand
and One Nights" being an individual work, and not one of many
similar collections, seem to me to be conclusive: not the least
important of these is the fact that no similar collection is known
to exist, nor is mentioned by any Arab author, with the sole exception
of the old "Thousand Nights," which I believe he has
demonstrated to be the prototype, in a remote degree, of the
"Thousand and One." To cite the words of the Preface on the
question of the original of the work as it is known to us&mdash;"I have
shewn it to be my opinion that all the complete copies of 'The
Thousand and One Nights' now known are in the main derived,
though not immediately, from one original; and I hold the same
opinion with respect to every fragment containing the commencement
of the work;" "not regarding the work as wholly original,
nor as the first of its kind; for many of the tales which it contains
are doubtless of different and early origins; and I think that its
general plan is probably borrowed from a much older production,
bearing the same title of 'The Thousand and One Nights,' [or
'The Thousand Nights,'] a translation of a Persian work having
a corresponding title, namely 'Hez&aacute;r Afs&aacute;neh.'... One thing
is certain&mdash;that 'The Thousand and One Nights,' [or 'The
Thousand Nights,'] translated from the Persian was much older
than the work now known by that title, and also extremely different
from the latter."</p>

<p>When these facts are considered in reference to each other, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
date assigned, in the Review, to the composition of the work
cannot reasonably be regarded as far from the truth. It is in
Egypt, and especially in the Memlook court, that we must look to
find the people, the manners, and the habits of thought, of "The
Arabian Nights;" while the style of the language in which they
are written is that which we might expect from an Egyptian of
those times, who, unskilled in the classical Arabic, yet endeavouring
to imitate it, was doubtless more generally intelligible then
than he is now to the modern Egyptians. This assumption of the
old language, I may remark, is, and always has been, characteristic
of all learned Arabs, be they Egyptians or natives of other Arabian
countries (for such Egypt truly is); but no other instance exists
of a work of fiction in which the attempt fails so singularly in
affecting the classical, or retaining the modern tongue; while all
other Arabic <i>tales</i> are certainly composed in either the one or
the other. The modern Egyptian romances are mostly written in
the colloquial dialect of every-day life; but those which are of
older date are not <i>modernized</i>, as some have supposed, against all
reason, "The Thousand and One Nights" to be: such an alteration
would be without a parallel in Arabic literature, as Mr. Lane
proves in the Review in a way to relieve me of the necessity of
further alluding here to this particular question. "The Thousand
and One Nights" exhibit a style which would be unfamiliar to the
audience of the reciter of romances, without attaining to the
classical diction: and the conclusion is forced on us that the work
exhibits the language of a by-gone generation, which (taking into
consideration the other indications of its age and country), is, it
can scarcely be disputed, that of the later period of the Memlook
rulers of Egypt, before the Turkish conquest of that country. In
the words of Mr. Lane's Preface:&mdash;"Most of the tales which it
contains are doubtless of an older <i>origin</i>, and many of them
founded upon very old traditions and legends; but all these traditions
or legends were evidently remodelled so as to become
pictures of the state of manners which existed among the Arabs,
and especially among those of Egypt, at the period here mentioned;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
and I think that the composer of the work, or each of the composers,
if one commenced and another completed it, was an Egyptian."</p>

<p>But a more popular subject than its obscure origin is the
literary merit of this work. The rare fascination of these old
Arab stories, their supernatural romance, excessive love, quaint
philosophy, and grotesque humour, have, since the days of
Galland, secured to them more readers than any other profane
work. The translation of Galland, with all its lameness, puerility,
and indecency, gained for them a hold which has never been
relaxed; and it only required the appearance of a scholarlike and
readable translation, freed from these defects, to make them generally
accepted in English families. The fashion of travelling in the
East has not a little added to the desire for a standard and annotated
edition of a work unique, even in those lands of genii and
adventure, in its remarkable portrayal of Eastern character, life,
and, when closely translated, idiom. The humour of the book, now
broad, now subtle, (who does not delight in K&aacute;foor and his "half
lie?") renders the comic stories generally superior to the romantic;
but the pathos perhaps excels every other beauty. The story of
Shems-en-Nah&aacute;r is remarkable for this characteristic; and that
of 'Azeez and 'Azeezeh (first published in this translation),
surpasses in delicate tenderness any Arab tale with which we are
acquainted.</p>

<p>Of the critical value of Mr. Lane's translation I ought scarcely
to speak. Yet I may observe that students of Arabic make it a
text-book in reading the original; while the English reader not
uncommonly forgets that it is a translation, and detects not the
literal accuracy of its rendering of an unfamiliar, or unknown,
language.</p>

<p>I have adverted to the system adopted in transcribing foreign
words, and I now conclude these preliminary remarks (intended
only to render the learned Review easier of perusal to the general
reader, and to smooth his first steps in a strange land), by quoting,
with some slight improvements by Mr. Lane, the explanation of
that system given in the preface to the first edition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span></p>

<p>"In writing Arabic and other Oriental words in the present
work, I have employed a system congenial with our language, and
of the most simple kind; and to this system I adhere in every
case, for the sake of uniformity as well as <i>truth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Some persons
have objected to my writing in this manner a few familiar words
which are found in our dictionaries; but they will excuse me for
remarking that general usage is not altogether accordant with their
opinion. Almost every author, I believe, now writes 'Koran,'
or 'Kur&aacute;n,' and 'Pasha,' or 'Pacha,' for our dictionary-words
'Alcoran' and 'Bashaw;' and most of our best authors on
Arabian History, of late, have written 'Khalif' for 'Caliph.'
In a work relating to a people who pronounce the Arabic w as v, I
should write 'Vezeer' for the Arabic word 'Wezeer;' but to do
so when the subject is Arabian, I consider inexpedient: and in this
opinion I am upheld by a great majority of literary and other
friends whom I have consulted on the subject, in the proportion of
five to one. I may add that Dr. Johnson has written in his
Dictionary, 'Vizier [properly <i>Wazir</i>];' and if we express the
Arabic vowels by their <i>Italian</i> equivalents, it <i>is</i> properly 'Waz&iacute;r'
or 'Wez&iacute;r.'&mdash;The system which I here employ requires but little
explanation; the general reader may be directed to pronounce</p>

<p>I have only to add one more extract from Mr. Lane's Preface.</p>

<p>"Many of the engravings which are so numerously interspersed
in this work will considerably assist to explain both the Text and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>the Notes; and to insure their accuracy, to the utmost of my
ability, I have supplied the artist with modern dresses, and with
other requisite materials. Thus he has been enabled to make
his designs agree more nearly with the costumes &amp;c. of the
times which the tales generally illustrate than they would if he
trusted alone to the imperfect descriptions which I have found
in Arabic works.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Except in a few cases, when I had given him
such directions as I deemed necessary, his original designs have
been submitted to me; and in suggesting any corrections, I have,
as much as possible, avoided fettering his imagination, which needs
no eulogy from me. He has acquired a general notion of Arabian
architecture from the great work of Murphy on the Arabian
remains in Spain, and from the splendid and accurate work on
the Alhambra by Messrs. Goury and Jones; and through the
kindness of my friend Mr. Hay, of Linplum, he has been allowed
to make a similar use of a very accurate and very beautiful
collection of drawings of a great number of the finest specimens
of Arabian architecture in and around Cairo, executed by M.
Pascal Coste, and now the property of Mr. Hay.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> He has also
consulted a number of Oriental drawings, and various other
sources. My acknowledgments to other persons I have expressed
in several of the Notes.</p>

<p>"The portion which is comprised in the first volume of this
translation, terminates with part of the hundred and thirty-seventh
Night: it is therefore necessary to remark,&mdash;first, that
there is less to omit in the early part of the original work than
in the later:&mdash;secondly, that the <i>Nights</i> in the early part are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>generally much <i>longer</i> than in the subsequent portion; the first
hundred Nights (without the Introduction) comprising 213 pages
in the Cairo edition of the original work; the second hundred,
149 pages; the third, 107; the fourth, 106; the fifth, 94:<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>&mdash;thirdly,
that a similar observation applies to the <i>Notes</i> which are
inserted in my translation; those appended to the early tales
being necessarily much more copious than the others."</p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">1</span></a> Two other printed editions were also used by Mr. Lane&mdash;that of the first two
hundred Nights, printed at Calcutta, and in consequence of the loss, by shipwreck, of
nearly the whole impression of the first volume, never completed; and that of Breslau.
The former differs much, in matter and manner, from any other known copy; the
latter, which was edited to the close of the seven hundred and third night by Professor
Habicht, and completed by Professor Fleischer, is far inferior to all the others. One
other edition has appeared in the Arabic, that of Calcutta, or "the Calcutta edition
of the complete work." It was brought from Cairo, and is apparently (though not
immediately) from the same original as the Bool&aacute;&#7731; edition. I have continually
referred to it for various readings, without finding any one of importance. And here
I must animadvert on the practice of German orientalists of wasting their own
time and their readers' patience in collecting such various readings of a work like "The
Thousand and One Nights" as must necessarily be the result of the carelessness or the
ignorance of copyists and reciters. The habit is unfortunately adopted by some
Englishmen, who seem to imagine that all that is German is therefore learned.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.</p></div>

of the sheykh Mo&#7717;ammad 'Eiy&aacute;d, or by my having been long in the habit

to the purpose of expressing the sounds of Arabic than the Italian. Besides, I believe
it is the custom of every other European nation, in transcribing Oriental words, to
employ a system congenial with its own language. In a former work, I made use of a
double h to express a very strong Arabic aspirate (as others had done before me), and
the word 'Hh&aacute;gg' or 'Hh&aacute;jj' was pointed out by a critic as one remarkably uncouth:

<p>To proceed:&mdash;The lives of
former generations are a lesson
to posterity; that a man may
review the remarkable events<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
which have happened to others, and be admonished; and may consider
the history of people of preceding ages, and of all that hath
befallen them, and be restrained. Extolled be the perfection of
Him who hath thus ordained the history of former generations to be
a lesson to those which follow. Such are the Tales of a Thousand
and One Nights, with their romantic stories and their fables.</p>

<p>It is related (but God alone is all-knowing,<a href="#intro3" class="fnanchor">3</a> as well as all-wise,
and almighty, and all-bountiful,) that there was, in ancient times, a
King<a href="#intro4" class="fnanchor">4</a> of the countries of India and China, possessing numerous troops,
and guards, and servants, and domestic dependents: and he had two
sons; one of whom was a man of mature age; and the other, a youth.
Both of these princes were brave horsemen; but especially the elder,
who inherited the kingdom of his father; and governed his subjects
with such justice that the inhabitants of his country and whole empire
loved him. He was called King Shahriy&aacute;r:<a href="#intro5" class="fnanchor">5</a> his younger brother
was named Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n,<a href="#intro6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and was King of Samar&#7731;and.<a href="#intro7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The administration
of their governments was conducted with rectitude, each
of them ruling over his subjects with justice during a period of twenty
years with the utmost enjoyment and happiness. After this period,
the elder King felt a strong desire to see his brother, and ordered his
Wezeer<a href="#intro8" class="fnanchor">8</a> to repair to him and bring him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f9" id="f9"></a><img src="images/fig9.png" width="500" height="490"
alt="The Wezeer presenting the letter to Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n" title="The Wezeer presenting the letter to Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n" /></div>

<p>Having taken the advice of the Wezeer on this subject,<a href="#intro9" class="fnanchor">9</a> he immediately
gave orders to prepare handsome presents, such as horses
adorned with gold and costly jewels, and memlooks, and beautiful
virgins, and expensive stuffs.<a href="#intro10" class="fnanchor">10</a> He then wrote a letter to his brother,
expressive of his great desire to see him;<a href="#intro11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and having sealed it, and
given it to the Wezeer, together with the presents above mentioned,
he ordered the minister to strain his nerves, and tuck up his skirts,
and use all expedition in returning. The Wezeer answered, without
delay, I hear and obey; and forthwith prepared for the journey: he
packed his baggage, removed the burdens, and made ready all his
provisions within three days; and on the fourth day, he took leave
of the King Shahriy&aacute;r, and went forth towards the deserts and wastes.
He proceeded night and day; and each of the kings under the
authority of King Shahriy&aacute;r by whose residence he passed came forth
to meet him,<a href="#intro12" class="fnanchor">12</a> with costly presents, and gifts of gold and silver, and
entertained him three days;<a href="#intro13" class="fnanchor">13</a> after which, on the fourth day, he
accompanied him one day's journey, and took leave of him. Thus he
continued on his way until he drew near to the city of Samar&#7731;and,
when he sent forward a messenger to inform King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
his approach. The messenger entered the city, inquired the way to
the palace, and, introducing himself to the King, kissed the ground
before him,<a href="#intro14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and acquainted him with the approach of his brother's
Wezeer; upon which Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n ordered the chief officers of his
court, and the great men of his kingdom, to go forth a day's journey
to meet him; and they did so; and when they met him, they welcomed
him, and walked by his stirrups until they returned to the city.
The Wezeer then presented himself before the King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n,
greeted him with a prayer for the divine assistance in his favour,
kissed the ground before him, and informed him of his brother's
desire to see him; after which he handed to him the letter. The
King took it, read it, and understood its contents;<a href="#intro15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and answered
by expressing his readiness to obey the commands of his brother.
But, said he (addressing the Wezeer), I will not go until I have entertained
thee three days. Accordingly, he lodged him in a palace
befitting his rank, accommodated his troops in tents, and appointed
them all things requisite in the way of food and drink: and so they
remained three days. On the fourth day, he equipped himself for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the journey, made ready his baggage, and collected together costly
presents suitable to his brother's dignity.</p>

<p>These preparations being completed, he sent forth his tents and
camels and mules and servants and guards, appointed his Wezeer to
be governor of the country during his absence, and set out towards his
brother's dominions. At midnight,<a href="#intro16" class="fnanchor">16</a> however, he remembered that he
had left in his palace an article which he should have brought with
him; and having returned to the palace to fetch it, he there beheld
his wife sleeping in his bed, and attended by a male negro slave, who
had fallen asleep by her side. On beholding this scene, the world
became black before his eyes; and he said within himself, If this is
the case when I have not departed from the city, what will be the
conduct of this vile woman while I am sojourning with my brother?
He then drew his sword, and slew them both in the bed: after which
he immediately returned, gave orders for departure, and journeyed to
his brother's capital.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><a name="f10" id="f10"></a><img src="images/fig10.png" width="250" height="350"
alt="Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n, after having killed his Wife" title="Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n, after having killed his Wife" /></div>

<p>Shahriy&aacute;r, rejoicing at the tidings of his approach, went forth to
meet him, saluted him, and welcomed him with the utmost delight.
He then ordered that the city should be decorated on the occasion,<a href="#intro17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
and sat down to entertain his brother with cheerful conversation: but
the mind of King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n was distracted by reflections upon the
conduct of his wife; excessive grief took possession of him; and his
countenance became sallow; and his frame, emaciated. His brother
observed his altered condition, and, imagining that it was occasioned
by his absence from his dominions, abstained from troubling him or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
asking respecting the cause, until after the lapse of some days, when
at length he said to him, O my brother, I perceive that thy body is
emaciated, and thy countenance is become sallow. He answered, O
brother, I have an internal sore:&mdash;and he informed him not of the
conduct of his wife which he had witnessed. Shahriy&aacute;r then said,
I wish that thou wouldest go out with me on a hunting excursion;
perhaps thy mind might so be diverted:&mdash;but he declined; and
Shahriy&aacute;r went alone to the chase.<a href="#intro18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f11" id="f11"></a><img src="images/fig11.png" width="550" height="383"
alt="Meeting of Shahriy&aacute;r and Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n" title="Meeting of Shahriy&aacute;r and Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n" /></div>

<p>Now there were some windows in the King's palace commanding
a view of his garden; and while his brother was looking out from one
of these, a door of the palace was opened, and there came forth from
it twenty females and twenty male black slaves; and the King's wife,
who was distinguished by extraordinary beauty and elegance,<a href="#intro19" class="fnanchor">19</a> accompanied
them to a fountain, where they all disrobed themselves,
and sat down together. The King's wife then called out, O Mes'ood!<a href="#intro20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
and immediately a black slave came to her, and embraced her; she
doing the like. So also did the other slaves and the women; and all
of them continued revelling together until the close of the day.
When Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n beheld this spectacle, he said within himself,
By Allah! my affliction is lighter than this! His vexation and
grief were alleviated, and he no longer abstained from sufficient food
and drink.</p>

<p>When his brother returned from his excursion, and they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
saluted each other, and King Shahriy&aacute;r observed his brother Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n,
that his colour had returned, that his face had recovered the
flush of health, and that he ate with appetite, after his late abstinence,
he was surprised, and said, O my brother, when I saw thee last, thy
countenance was sallow, and now thy colour hath returned to thee:
acquaint me with thy state.&mdash;As to the change of my natural
complexion, answered Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n, I will inform thee of its cause;
but excuse my explaining to thee the return of my colour.&mdash;First,
said Shahriy&aacute;r, relate to me the cause of the change of thy proper
complexion, and of thy weakness: let me hear it.&mdash;Know then, O my
brother, he answered, that when thou sentest thy Wezeer to me to
invite me to thy presence, I prepared myself for the journey, and
when I had gone forth from the city, I remembered that I had left
behind me the jewel that I have given thee; I therefore returned to
my palace for it, and there I found my wife sleeping in my bed, and
attended by a black male slave; and I killed them both, and came
to thee: but my mind was occupied by reflections upon this affair,
and this was the cause of the change of my complexion, and of my
weakness: now, as to the return of my colour, excuse my informing
thee of its cause.&mdash;But when his brother heard these words, he said,
I conjure thee by Allah that thou acquaint me with the cause of the
return of thy colour:&mdash;so he repeated to him all that he had seen.
I would see this, said Shahriy&aacute;r, with my own eye.&mdash;Then, said Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n,
give out that thou art going again to the chase, and conceal
thyself here with me, and thou shalt witness this conduct, and obtain
ocular proof of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

<img src="images/fig12.png" width="550" height="251" alt="Shahriy&aacute;r's return from the Chase" title="Shahriy&aacute;r's return from the Chase" /></div>

<p>Shahriy&aacute;r, upon this, immediately announced that it was his intention
to make another excursion. The troops went out of the city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
with the tents, and the King followed them; and after he had reposed
awhile in the camp, he said to his servants, Let no one come in to
me:&mdash;and he disguised himself, and returned to his brother in the
palace, and sat in one of the windows overlooking the garden; and
when he had been there a short time, the women and their mistress
entered the garden with the black slaves, and did as his brother had
described, continuing so until the hour of the afternoon-prayer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f13" id="f13"></a><img src="images/fig13.png" width="550" height="545" alt="Garden of Shahriy&aacute;r's Palace" title="Garden of Shahriy&aacute;r's Palace" /></div>
<hr />
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f14" id="f14"></a><img src="images/fig14.png" width="550" height="597" alt="'Efreet and Lady" title="'Efreet and Lady" /></div>

<p>When King Shahriy&aacute;r beheld this occurrence, reason fled from his
head, and he said to his brother Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n, Arise, and let us travel
whither we please, and renounce the regal state, until we see whether
such a calamity as this have befallen any other person like unto us;
and if not, our death will be preferable to our life. His brother
agreed to his proposal, and they went out from a private door of the
palace, and journeyed continually, days and nights, until they arrived
at a tree in the midst of a meadow, by a spring of water, on the
shore of the sea. They drank of this spring, and sat down to rest;
and when the day had a little advanced, the sea became troubled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
before them, and there arose from it a black pillar, ascending towards
the sky, and approaching the meadow. Struck with fear at the sight,
they climbed up into the tree, which was lofty; and thence they gazed
to see what this might be: and behold, it was a Jinnee,<a href="#intro21" class="fnanchor">21</a> of gigantic
stature, broad-fronted and bulky, bearing on his head a chest.<a href="#intro22" class="fnanchor">22</a> He
landed, and came to the tree into which the two Kings had climbed,
and, having seated himself beneath it, opened the chest, and took out
of it another box, which he also opened; and there came forth from it
a young woman, fair and beautiful, like the shining sun. When the
Jinnee cast his eyes upon her, he said, O lady of noble race, whom I
carried off on thy wedding-night, I have a desire to sleep a little:&mdash;and
he placed his head upon her knee, and slept. The damsel then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
raised her head towards the tree, and saw there the two Kings; upon
which she removed the head of the Jinnee from her knee, and, having
placed it on the ground, stood under the tree, and made signs to the
two Kings, as though she would say, Come down, and fear not this
'Efreet.<a href="#intro23" class="fnanchor">23</a> They answered her, We conjure thee by Allah that thou
excuse us in this matter. But she said, I conjure you by the same
that ye come down; and if ye do not, I will rouse this 'Efreet, and
he shall put you to a cruel death. So, being afraid, they came down
to her; and, after they had remained with her as long as she required,
she took from her pocket a purse, and drew out from this a string,
upon which were ninety-eight seal-rings;<a href="#intro24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and she said to them, Know
ye what are these? They answered, We know not.&mdash;The owners of
these rings, said she, have, all of them, been admitted to converse
with me, like as ye have, unknown to this foolish 'Efreet; therefore,
give me your two rings,<a href="#intro25" class="fnanchor">25</a> ye brothers. So they gave her their two rings
from their fingers; and she then said to them, This 'Efreet carried
me off on my wedding-night, and put me in the box, and placed the
box in the chest, and affixed to the chest seven locks, and deposited
me, thus imprisoned, in the bottom of the roaring sea, beneath the
dashing waves; not knowing that, when one of our sex desires to accomplish
any object, nothing can prevent her. In accordance with
this, says one of the poets:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Never trust in women; nor rely upon their vows;</span>
<span class="i0">For their pleasure and displeasure depend upon their passions.</span>
<span class="i0">They offer a false affection; for perfidy lurks within their clothing.</span>
<span class="i0">By the tale of Yoosuf<a href="#intro26" class="fnanchor">26</a> be admonished, and guard against their stratagems.</span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou not consider that Iblees ejected Adam by means of woman?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And another poet says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Abstain from censure; for it will strengthen the censured, and increase desire into violent passion.</span>
<span class="i0">If I suffer such passion, my case is but the same as that of many a man before me:</span>
<span class="i0">For greatly indeed to be wondered at is he who hath kept himself safe from women's artifice.<a href="#intro27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the two Kings heard these words from her lips, they were
struck with the utmost astonishment, and said, one to the other, If
this is an 'Efreet, and a greater calamity hath happened unto him
than that which hath befallen us, this is a circumstance that should
console us:&mdash;and immediately they departed, and returned to the city.</p>

<p>As soon as they had entered the palace, Shahriy&aacute;r caused his
wife to be beheaded, and in like manner the women and black slaves;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and thenceforth he made it his regular custom, every time that he
took a virgin to his bed, to kill her at the expiration of the night.
Thus he continued to do during a period of three years; and the
people raised an outcry against him, and fled with their daughters,
and there remained not a virgin in the city of a sufficient age for
marriage.<a href="#intro28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Such was the case when the King ordered the Wezeer to
bring him a virgin according to his custom; and the Wezeer went
forth and searched, and found none; and he went back to his house
enraged and vexed, fearing what the King might do to him.</p>

<p>Now the Wezeer had two daughters; the elder of whom was
named Shahraz&aacute;d; and the younger, Duny&aacute;z&aacute;d. The former had
read various books of histories, and the lives of preceding kings, and
stories of past generations: it is asserted that she had collected
together a thousand books of histories, relating to preceding generations
and kings, and works of the poets: and she said to her father
on this occasion, Why do I see thee thus changed, and oppressed with
solicitude and sorrows? It has been said by one of the poets:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tell him who is oppressed with anxiety, that anxiety will not last:</span>
<span class="i0">As happiness passeth away, so passeth away anxiety.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Wezeer heard these words from his daughter, he related to
her all that had happened to him with regard to the King: upon
which she said, By Allah, O my father, give me in marriage to this
King: either I shall die, and be a ransom for one of the daughters of
the Muslims, or I shall live, and be the cause of their deliverance from
him.<a href="#intro29" class="fnanchor">29</a>&mdash;I conjure thee by Allah, exclaimed he, that thou expose not
thyself to such peril:&mdash;but she said, It must be so. Then, said he, I
fear for thee that the same will befall thee that happened in the case of
the ass and the bull and the husbandman.&mdash;And what, she asked, was
that, O my father.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f15" id="f15"></a><img src="images/fig15.png" width="550" height="616" alt="The Wezeer and his two Daughters" title="The Wezeer and his two Daughters" /></div>

<p>Know, O my daughter, said the Wezeer, that there was a certain
merchant, who possessed wealth and cattle, and had a wife and
children; and God, whose name be exalted, had also endowed him
with the knowledge of the languages of beasts and birds.<a href="#intro30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The
abode of this merchant was in the country; and he had, in his house,
an ass and a bull.<a href="#intro31" class="fnanchor">31</a> When the bull came to the place where the ass
was tied, he found it swept and sprinkled;<a href="#intro32" class="fnanchor">32</a> in his manger were
sifted barley and sifted cut straw,<a href="#intro33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and the ass was lying at his
ease; his master being accustomed only to ride him occasionally,
when business required, and soon to return: and it happened, one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
day, that the merchant overheard the bull saying to the ass, May
thy food benefit thee!<a href="#intro34" class="fnanchor">34</a> I am oppressed with fatigue, while thou art
enjoying repose: thou eatest sifted barley, and men serve thee; and
it is only occasionally that thy master rides thee, and returns; while I
am continually employed in ploughing, and turning the mill.<a href="#intro35" class="fnanchor">35</a>&mdash;The
ass answered,<a href="#intro36" class="fnanchor">36</a> When thou goest out to the field, and they place the
yoke upon thy neck, lie down, and do not rise again, even if they
beat thee; or, if thou rise, lie down a second time; and when they
take thee back, and place the beans before thee, eat them not, as
though thou wert sick: abstain from eating and drinking a day, or
two days, or three; and so shalt thou find rest from trouble and
labour.&mdash;Accordingly, when the driver came to the bull with his
fodder, he ate scarcely any of it; and on the morrow, when the driver
came again to take him to plough, he found him apparently quite
infirm: so the merchant said, Take the ass, and make him draw the
plough in his stead all the day. The man did so; and when the
ass returned at the close of the day, the bull thanked him for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
favour he had conferred upon him by relieving him of his trouble
on that day; but the ass returned him no answer, for he repented
most grievously. On the next day, the ploughman came again, and
took the ass, and ploughed with him till evening; and the ass returned
with his neck flayed by the yoke, and reduced to an extreme state of
weakness; and the bull looked upon him, and thanked and praised
him. The ass exclaimed, I was living at ease, and nought but my
meddling hath injured me! Then said he to the bull, Know that I
am one who would give thee good advice: I heard our master say, If
the bull rise not from his place, take him to the butcher, that he may
kill him, and make a na&#7789;&#7841;<a href="#intro37" class="fnanchor">37</a> of his skin:&mdash;I am therefore in fear for
thee, and so I have given thee advice; and peace be on thee!&mdash;When
the bull heard these words of the ass, he thanked him, and said,
To-morrow I will go with alacrity:&mdash;so he ate the whole of his fodder,
and even licked the manger.&mdash;Their master, meanwhile, was listening
to their conversation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; position: relative;"><a name="f16" id="f16"></a><img src="images/fig16.png" width="400" height="142" alt="The Ass at Plough" title="The Ass at Plough" /></div>

<p>On the following morning, the merchant and his wife went to the
bull's crib, and sat down there; and the driver came, and took out the
bull; and when the bull saw his master, he shook his tail, and showed
his alacrity by sounds and actions, bounding about in such a manner
that the merchant laughed until he fell backwards. His wife, in
surprise, asked him, At what dost thou laugh? He answered, At a
thing that I have heard and seen; but I cannot reveal it; for if I did,
I should die. She said, Thou must inform me of the cause of thy
laughter, even if thou die.&mdash;I cannot reveal it, said he: the fear of
death prevents me.&mdash;Thou laughedst only at <i>me</i>, she said; and she
ceased not to urge and importune him until he was quite overcome and
distracted. So he called together his children, and sent for the
&#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee<a href="#intro38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and witnesses, that he might make his will, and reveal the
secret to her, and die: for he loved her excessively, since she was
the daughter of his paternal uncle, and the mother of his children,
and he had lived with her to the age of a hundred and twenty years.<a href="#intro39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
Having assembled her family and his neighbours, he related to them
his story, and told them that as soon as he revealed his secret he
must die; upon which every one present said to her, We conjure
thee by Allah that thou give up this affair, and let not thy husband,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
and the father of thy children, die. But she said, I will not desist
until he tell me, though he die for it. So they ceased to solicit her;
and the merchant left them, and went to the stable to perform the
ablution, and then to return, and tell them the secret, and die.<a href="#intro40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; position: relative;"><a name="f17" id="f17"></a><img src="images/fig17.png" width="400" height="127" alt="The Dog and the Cock" title="The Dog and the Cock" /></div>

<p>Now he had a cock, with fifty hens under him, and he had also
a dog; and he heard the dog call to the cock, and reproach him,
saying, Art thou happy when our master is going to die? The cock
asked, How so?&mdash;and the dog related to him the story; upon which
the cock exclaimed, By Allah! our master has little sense: <i>I</i> have
<i>fifty</i> wives; and I please this, and provoke that; while <i>he</i> has but <i>one</i>
wife, and cannot manage this affair with her: why does he not take
some twigs of the mulberry-tree, and enter her chamber, and beat her
until she dies or repents? She would never, after that, ask him a
question respecting anything.&mdash;And when the merchant heard the
words of the cock, as he addressed the dog, he recovered his reason,
and made up his mind to beat her.&mdash;Now, said the Wezeer to his
daughter Shahraz&aacute;d, perhaps I may do to thee as the merchant did
to his wife. She asked, And what did he? He answered, He entered
her chamber, after he had cut off some twigs of the mulberry-tree,
and hidden them there; and then said to her, Come into the chamber,
that I may tell thee the secret while no one sees me, and then die:&mdash;and
when she had entered, he locked the chamber-door upon her, and
beat her until she became almost senseless and cried out, I repent:&mdash;and
she kissed his hands and his feet, and repented, and went out
with him; and all the company, and her own family, rejoiced; and
they lived together in the happiest manner until death.</p>

<p>When the Wezeer's daughter heard the words of her father, she
said to him, It must be as I have requested. So he arrayed her, and
went to the King Shahriy&aacute;r. Now she had given directions to her
young sister, saying to her, When I have gone to the King, I will
send to request thee to come; and when thou comest to me, and
seest a convenient time, do thou say to me, O my sister, relate to me
some strange story to beguile our waking hour:<a href="#intro41" class="fnanchor">41</a>&mdash;and I will relate to
thee a story that shall, if it be the will of God, be the means of procuring
deliverance.</p>

<p>Her father, the Wezeer, then took her to the King, who, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
he saw him, was rejoiced, and said, Hast thou brought me what I
desired? He answered, Yes. When the King, therefore, introduced
himself to her, she wept; and he said to her, What aileth thee? She
answered, O King, I have a young sister, and I wish to take leave
of her. So the King sent to her; and she came to her sister, and
embraced her, and sat near the foot of the bed; and after she had
waited for a proper opportunity, she said, By Allah! O my sister,
relate to us a story to beguile the waking hour of our night. Most
willingly, answered Shahraz&aacute;d, if this virtuous King permit me. And
the King, hearing these words, and being restless, was pleased with
the idea of listening to the story; and thus, on the first night of the
thousand and one, Shahraz&aacute;d commenced her recitations.</p>

<h4>NOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro1" id="intro1">1.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Initial Phrase, and on the Mohammadan Religion and Laws.</i> It is
a universal custom of the Muslims to write this phrase at the commencement of every
book, whatever may be the subject, and to pronounce it on commencing every lawful
act of any importance. This they do in imitation of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n (every chapter of
which, excepting one, is thus prefaced), and in accordance with a precept of their
Prophet. The words which I translate "Compassionate" and "Merciful" are both
derived from the same root, and have nearly the same meaning: the one being of a
form which is generally used to express an accidental or occasional passion or sensation;
the other, to denote a constant quality: but the most learned of the 'Ulam&agrave; (or professors
of religion and law, &amp;c.) interpret the former as signifying "Merciful in great
things;" and the latter, "Merciful in small things." Sale has erred in rendering
them, conjunctly, "Most merciful."</p>

<p>In the books of the Muslims, the first words, after the above phrase, almost always
consist (as in the work before us) of some form of praise and thanksgiving to God for
his power and goodness, followed by an invocation of blessing on the Prophet; and in
general, when the author is not very concise in these expressions, he conveys in them
some allusion to the subject of his book. For instance, if he write on marriage, he will
commence his work with some such form as this (after the phrase first mentioned)&mdash;"Praise
be to God, who hath created the human race, and made them males and
females," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The exordium of the present work, showing the duty imposed upon a Muslim by
his religion, even on the occasion of his commencing the composition or compilation of
a series of fictions, suggests to me the necessity of inserting a brief prefatory notice of
the fundamental points of his faith, and the principal laws of the ritual and moral, the
civil, and the criminal code; leaving more full explanations of particular points to be
given when occasions shall require such illustrations.</p>

<p>The confession of the Muslim's faith is briefly made in these words:&mdash;"There is no
deity but God: Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle:"&mdash;which imply a belief and observance
of everything that Mo&#7717;ammad taught to be the word or will of God. In the opinion of
those who are commonly called orthodox, and termed "Sunnees" (the only class whom
we have to consider; for they are Sunnee tenets and Arab manners which are described
in this work in almost every case, wherever the scene is laid), the Mohammadan code
is founded upon the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, the Traditions of the Prophet, the concordance of his
principal early disciples, and the decisions which have been framed from analogy or
comparison. This class consists of four sects, &#7716;anafees, Sh&aacute;fe'ees, M&aacute;likees, and
&#7716;ambelees; so called after the names of their respective founders. The other sects,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
who are called "Shiya'ees" (an appellation particularly given to the Persian sect, but
also used to designate generally all who are not Sunnees), are regarded by their
opponents in general nearly in the same light as those who do not profess El-Isl&aacute;m
(or the Mohammadan faith); that is, as destined to eternal or severe punishment.</p>

<p>The Mohammadan faith embraces the following points:</p>

<p>1. Belief in God, who is without beginning or end, the sole Creator and Lord of
the universe, having absolute power, and knowledge, and glory, and perfection.</p>

<p>2. Belief in his Angels, who are impeccable beings, created of light; and Genii
(Jinn), who are peccable, created of smokeless fire. The Devils, whose chief is Iblees,
or Satan, are evil Genii.</p>

<p>3. Belief in his Scriptures, which are his uncreated word, revealed to his prophets.
Of these there now exist, but held to be greatly corrupted, the Pentateuch of Moses,
the Psalms of David, and the Gospels of Jesus Christ; and, in an uncorrupted and
incorruptible state, the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, which is held to have abrogated, and to surpass in
excellence, all preceding revelations.</p>

<p>4. Belief in his Prophets and Apostles;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> the most distinguished of whom are Adam,
Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mo&#7717;ammad. Jesus is held to be more excellent
than any of those who preceded him; to have been born of a virgin, and to be the
Messiah, and the word of God, and a Spirit proceeding from Him, but not partaking of
his essence, and not to be called the Son of God. Mo&#7717;ammad is held to be more excellent
than all; the last and greatest of prophets and apostles; the most excellent of the
creatures of God.</p>

<p>5. Belief in the general resurrection and judgment, and in future rewards and
punishments, chiefly of a corporeal nature: that the punishments will be eternal to all
but wicked Mohammadans; and that none but Mohammadans will enter into a state
of happiness.</p>

<p>6. Belief in God's predestination of all events, both good and evil.</p>

<p>The principal Ritual and Moral Laws are on the following subjects, of which the
first four are the most important.</p>

<p>1. Prayer (e&#7779;-&#7779;al&aacute;h, commonly pronounced e&#7779;-&#7779;alah), including preparatory purifications.
There are partial or total washings to be performed on particular occasions
which need not be mentioned. The ablution which is more especially preparatory to
prayer (and which is called wu&#7693;o&oacute;) consists in washing the hands, mouth, nostrils, face,
arms (as high as the elbow, the right first), each three times; and then the upper
part of the head, the beard, ears, neck, and feet, each once. This is done with running
water, or from a very large tank, or from a lake, or the sea.&mdash;Prayers are required
to be performed five times in the course of every day; between daybreak and sunrise,
between noon and the 'a&#7779;r (which latter period is about mid-time between noon and
nightfall), between the 'a&#7779;r and sunset, between sunset and the 'esh&egrave; (or the period
when the darkness of night commences), and at, or after, the 'esh&egrave;. The commencement
of each of these periods is announced by a chant (called ad&aacute;n), repeated by a crier
(mu&euml;ddin) from the m&aacute;d'neh, or menaret, of each mosque; and it is more meritorious
to commence the prayer then than at a later time. On each of these occasions, the
Muslim has to perform certain prayers held to be ordained by God, and others ordained
by the Prophet; each kind consisting of two, three, or four "rek'ahs;" which term
signifies the repetition of a set form of words, chiefly from the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and ejaculations
of "God is most Great!" &amp;c., accompanied by particular postures; part of the
words being repeated in an erect posture; part, sitting; and part, in other postures:
an inclination of the head and body, followed by two prostrations, distinguishing each
rek'ah. These prayers may in some cases be abridged, and in others entirely omitted.
Other prayers must be performed on particular occasions. 1. On Friday, the Mohammadan
Sabbath. These are congregational prayers, and are similar to those of other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>days, with additional prayers and exhortations by a minister, who is called Im&aacute;m, or
Kha&#7789;eeb. 2. On two grand annual festivals. 3. On the nights of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, the month
of abstinence. 4. On the occasion of an eclipse of the sun or moon. 5. For rain.
6. Previously to the commencement of battle. 7. In pilgrimage. 8. At funerals.</p>

<p>2. Alms-giving. An alms, called "zek&aacute;h," commonly pronounced "zekah," is
required by law to be given annually, to the poor, of camels, oxen (bulls and cows),
and buffaloes, sheep and goats, horses and mules and asses, and gold and silver
(whether in money or in vessels, ornaments, &amp;c.), provided the property be of a
certain amount, as five camels, thirty oxen, forty sheep, five horses, two hundred
dirhems, or twenty deen&aacute;rs. The proportion is generally one-fortieth, which is to be
paid in kind, or in money, or other equivalent.</p>

<p>3. Fasting (e&#7779;-&#7779;iy&aacute;m). The Muslim must abstain from eating and drinking, and
from every indulgence of the senses, every day during the month of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, from the
first appearance of daybreak until sunset, unless physically incapacitated.&mdash;On the first
day of the following month, a festival, called the Minor Festival, is observed with
public prayer, and with general rejoicing, which continues three days.</p>

<p>4. Pilgrimage (el-&#7717;ajj). It is incumbent on the Muslim, if able, to perform, at least
once in his life, the pilgrimage to Mekkeh and Mount 'Araf&aacute;t. The principal
ceremonies of the pilgrimage are completed on the 9th of the month of Zu-l-&#7716;ejjeh: on
the following day, which is the first of the Great Festival, on the return from 'Araf&aacute;t
to Mekkeh, the pilgrims who are able to do so perform a sacrifice, and every other
Muslim who can is required to do the same: part of the meat of the victim he should
eat, and the rest he should give to the poor. This festival is observed otherwise in a
similar manner to the minor one, above mentioned; and lasts three or four days.</p>

<p>The less important ritual and moral laws may here be briefly mentioned in a single
paragraph.&mdash;One of these is circumcision, which is not absolutely obligatory.&mdash;The distinctions
of clean and unclean meats are nearly the same in the Mohammedan as in
the Mosaic code. Camels' flesh is an exception; being lawful to the Muslim. Swine's
flesh, and blood, are especially condemned; and a particular mode of slaughtering
animals for food is enjoined, accompanied by the repetition of the name of God.&mdash;Wine
and all inebriating liquors are strictly forbidden.&mdash;So also are gaming and usury.&mdash;Music
is condemned; but most Muslims take great delight in hearing it.&mdash;Images
and pictures representing living creatures are contrary to law.&mdash;Charity, probity in all
transactions, veracity (excepting in a few cases), and modesty, are virtues indispensable.&mdash;Cleanliness
in person, and decent attire, are particularly required. Clothes of silk,
and ornaments of gold or silver, are forbidden to men, but allowed to women: this
precept, however, is often disregarded.&mdash;Utensils of gold and silver are also condemned:
yet they are used by many Muslims.&mdash;The manners of Muslims in society
are subject to particular laws or rules, with respect to salutations, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of the Civil Laws, the following notices will at present suffice.&mdash;A man may have
four wives at the same time, and, according to common opinion, as many concubine
slaves as he pleases.&mdash;He may divorce a wife twice, and each time take her back again;
but if he divorce her a third time, or by a triple sentence, he cannot make her his wife
again unless by her own consent, and by a new contract, and after another man has
consummated a marriage with her, and divorced her.&mdash;The children by a wife and those
by a concubine slave inherit equally, if the latter be acknowledged by the father.
Sons inherit equally: so also do daughters; but the share of a daughter is half that
of a son. One-eighth is the share of the wife or wives of the deceased if he have left
issue, and one-fourth if he have left no issue. A husband inherits one-fourth of his
wife's property if she have left issue, and one-half if she have left no issue. The debts
and legacies of the deceased must be first paid. A man may leave one-third of his
property in any way he pleases.&mdash;When a concubine slave has borne a child to her
master, she becomes entitled to freedom on his death.&mdash;There are particular laws
relating to commerce. Usury and monopoly are especially condemned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Of the Criminal Laws, a few only need here be mentioned. Murder is punishable
by death, or by a fine to be paid to the family of the deceased, if they prefer it.&mdash;Theft,
if the property stolen amount to a quarter of a deen&aacute;r, is to be punished by cutting
off the right hand, except under certain circumstances.&mdash;Adultery, if attested by four
eye-witnesses, is punishable by death (stoning): fornication, by a hundred stripes, and
banishment for a year.&mdash;Drunkenness is punished with eighty stripes.&mdash;Apostasy, persevered
in, by death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro2" id="intro2">2</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Arabian System of Cosmography.</i> The words translated "as a bed"
would be literally rendered "and the bed;" but the signification is that which I
have expressed. (See the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, ch. lxxviii. v. 6; and, with respect to what is
before said of the heavens, idem, ch. xiii. v. 2.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>) These, and the preceding words,
commencing with "the Beneficent King," I have introduced (in the place of "the
Lord of all creatures") from the Calcutta edition of the first two hundred nights, as
affording me an opportunity to explain here the Arabian system of Cosmography, with
which the reader of this work cannot be too early acquainted.</p>

<p>When we call to mind how far the Arabs surpassed their great master, Aristotle,
in natural and experimental philosophy, and remember that their brilliant discoveries
constituted an important link between those of the illustrious Greek and of our
equally illustrious countryman, Roger Bacon, their popular system of cosmography
becomes an interesting subject for our consideration.</p>

<p>According to the common opinion of the Arabs (an opinion sanctioned by the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n,
and by assertions of their Prophet, which almost all Muslims take in their literal sense),
there are Seven Heavens, one above another, and Seven Earths, one beneath another;
the earth which we inhabit being the highest of the latter, and next below the lowest
heaven. The upper surface of each heaven, and that of each earth, are believed to
be nearly plane, and are generally supposed to be circular; and are said to be five
hundred years' journey in width. This is also said to be the measure of the depth or
thickness of each heaven and each earth, and of the distance between each heaven
or earth and that next above or below it. Thus is explained a passage of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n,
(ch. lxv. last verse), in which it is said, that God hath created seven heavens and as many
earths, or stories of the earth, in accordance with traditions from the Prophet.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>&mdash;This
notion of the seven heavens appears to have been taken from the "seven spheres;" the
first of which is that of the Moon; the second, of Mercury; the third, of Venus; the
fourth, of the Sun; the fifth, of Mars; the sixth, of Jupiter; and the seventh, of
Saturn; each of which orbs was supposed to revolve round the earth in its proper
sphere. So also the idea of the seven earths seems to have been taken from the
division of the earth into seven climates; a division which has been adopted by
several Arab geographers.&mdash;But to return to the opinions of the religious and the
vulgar.</p>

<p>Traditions differ respecting the <i>fabric</i> of the seven heavens. In the most credible
account, according to a celebrated historian, the first is described as formed of emerald;
the second, of white silver; the third, of large white pearls; the fourth, of ruby; the
fifth, of red gold; the sixth, of yellow jacinth; and the seventh, of shining light.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>Some assert Paradise to be in the seventh heaven; and, indeed, I have found this
to be the general opinion of my Muslim friends: but the author above quoted proceeds
to describe, next above the seventh heaven, seven seas of light; then, an undefined
number of veils, or separations, of different substances, seven of each kind; and then,
Paradise, which consists of seven stages, one above another; the first (D&aacute;r el-Jel&aacute;l,
or the Mansion of Glory), of white pearls; the second (D&aacute;r es-Sel&aacute;m, or the Mansion
of Peace), of ruby; the third (Jennet el-Ma-w&agrave;, or the Garden of Rest), of green
chrysolite; the fourth (Jennet el-Khuld, or the Garden of Eternity), of green<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> coral;
the fifth (Jennet en-Na'eem, or the Garden of Delight), of white silver; the sixth
(Jennet el-Fird&oacute;s, or the Garden of Paradise), of red gold; and the seventh (Jennet
'Adn, or the Garden of Perpetual Abode, or&mdash;of Eden), of large pearls; this overlooking
all the former, and canopied by the Throne, or rather Empyrean, of the Compassionate
('Arsh Er-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n), <i>i. e.</i> of God.&mdash;These several regions of Paradise are described in
some traditions as forming so many degrees, or stages, ascended by steps.</p>

<p>Though the opinion before mentioned respecting the form of the earth which we
inhabit is that generally maintained by the Arabs, there have been, and still are, many
philosophical men among this people who have argued that it is a globe, because, as
El-&#7730;azweenee says, an eclipse of the moon has been observed to happen at different
hours of the night in eastern and western countries. Thus we find Ptolemy's measurement
of the earth quoted and explained by Ibn-El-Wardee:&mdash;The circumference of
the earth is 24,000 miles, or 8,000 leagues; the league being three miles; the mile,
3,000 royal cubits; the cubit, three spans; the span, twelve digits; the digit, five
barley-corns placed side by side; and the width of the barley-corn, six mule's-hairs.
El-Ma&#7731;reezee also, among the more intelligent Arabs, describes<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> the globular form of
the earth, and its arctic and antarctic regions, with their day of six months, and night
of six months, and their frozen waters, &amp;c.</p>

<p>For ourselves, however, it is necessary that we retain in our minds the opinions
first stated, with regard to the form and dimensions of our earth; agreeing with those
Muslims who allow not philosophy to trench upon revelation or sacred traditions. It
is written, say they, that God hath "spread out the earth,"<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> "as a bed,"<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and "as a
carpet;"<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and what is round or globular cannot be said to be spread out, nor compared
to a bed, or a carpet. It is therefore decided to be an almost plane expanse. The
continents and islands of the earth are believed by the Arabs (as they were by the
Greeks in the age of Homer and Hesiod) to be surrounded by "the Circumambient
Ocean," "el-Ba&#7717;r el-Mo&#7717;ee&#7789;;" and this ocean is described as bounded by a chain of
mountains called K&aacute;f, which encircle the whole as a ring, and confine and strengthen
the entire fabric. With respect to the extent of the earth, our faith must at least
admit the assertion of the Prophet, that its width (as well as its depth or thickness)
is equal to five hundred years' journey: allotting the space of two hundred to the
sea, two hundred to uninhabited desert, eighty to the country of Y&aacute;jooj and M&aacute;jooj (or
Gog and Magog), and the rest to the remaining creatures:<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> nay, vast as these limits
are, we must rather extend than contract them, unless we suppose some of the heroes of
this work to travel by circuitous routes. Another tradition will suit us better, wherein
it is said, that the inhabited portion of the earth is, with respect to the rest, as a
tent in the midst of a desert.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> But even according to the former assertion, it will
be remarked, that the countries now commonly known to the Arabs (from the western
extremity of Africa to the eastern limits of India, and from the southern confines
of Abyssinia to those of Russia,) occupy a comparatively insignificant portion of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>expanse. They are situated in the middle; Mekkeh, according to some,&mdash;or Jerusalem,
according to others,&mdash;being exactly in the centre. Adjacent to the tract occupied by
these countries are other lands and seas, partially known to the Arabs. On the north-west,
with respect to the central point, lies the country of the Christians, or Franks,
comprising the principal European nations; on the north, the country of Y&aacute;jooj and
M&aacute;jooj, before mentioned, occupying, in the maps of the Arabs, large tracts of Asia
and Europe; on the north-east, central Asia; on the east, E&#7779;-&#7778;een (or China); on
the south-east, the sea, or seas, of El-Hind (or India), and Ez-Zinj (or Southern
Ethiopia), the waves of which (or of the former of which) mingle with those of the
sea of E&#7779;-&#7778;een, beyond; on the south, the country of the Zinj; on the south-west, the
country of the Sood&aacute;n, or Blacks: on the west is a portion of the Circumambient Ocean,
which surrounds all the countries and seas already mentioned, as well as immense
unknown regions adjoining the former, and innumerable islands interspersed in the
latter. These <i>terr&aelig; incognit&aelig;</i> are the scenes of some of the greatest wonders described
in the present work; and are mostly peopled with Jinn, or Genii. On the Mo&#7717;ee&#7789;,
or Circumambient Ocean, is the 'Arsh Iblees, or Throne of Iblees: in a map accompanying
my copy of the work of Ibn-El-Wardee, a large yellow tract is marked with
this name, adjoining Southern Africa. The western portion of the Mo&#7717;ee&#7789; is often
called "the Sea of Darkness" (Ba&#7717;r e&#7827;-&#7826;ulum&aacute;t, or,&mdash;e&#7827;-&#7826;ulmeh). Under this name
(and the synonymous appellation of el-Ba&#7717;r el-Mu&#7827;lim) the Atlantic Ocean is described
by the author just mentioned; though, in the introduction to his work, he says that
the Sea of Darkness surrounds the Mo&#7717;ee&#7789;. The former may be considered either as
the western or the more remote portion of the latter. In the dark regions (E&#7827;-&#7826;ulum&aacute;t,
from which, perhaps, the above-mentioned portion of the Mo&#7717;ee&#7789; takes its
name),<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> in the south-west quarter of the earth, according to the same author, is the
Fountain of Life, of which El-Khi&#7693;r drank, and by virtue of which he still lives, and
will live till the day of judgment. This mysterious person, whom the vulgar and
some others regard as a prophet, and identify with Ily&aacute;s (Elias, or Elijah), and whom
some confound with St. George, was, according to the more approved opinion of the
learned, a just man, or saint, the Wezeer and counsellor of the first Zu-l-&#7730;arneyn, who
was a universal conqueror, but an equally doubtful personage, contemporary with the
patriarch Ibr&aacute;heem, or Abraham. El-Khi&#7693;r is said to appear frequently to Muslims
in perplexity, and to be generally clad in green garments; whence, according to some,
his name. The Prophet Ily&aacute;s (or Elias) is also related to have drunk of the Fountain
of Life. During the day-time, it is said, El-Khi&#7693;r wanders upon the seas, and directs
voyagers who go astray; while Ily&aacute;s perambulates the mountains or deserts, and directs
persons who chance to be led astray by the Ghools:<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> but at night, they meet together,
and guard the rampart of Y&aacute;jooj and M&aacute;jooj,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> to prevent these people from making
irruptions upon their neighbours. Both, however, are generally believed by the modern
Muslims to assist pious persons in distress in various circumstances, whether travelling
by land or by water.&mdash;The mountains of &#7730;&aacute;f, which bound the Circumambient Ocean,
and form a circular barrier round the whole of our earth, are described by interpreters
of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n as composed of green chrysolite, like the green tint of the sky.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> It is
the colour of these mountains, said the Prophet, that imparts a greenish hue to the
sky.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> It is said, in a tradition, that beyond these mountains are other countries; one
of gold, seventy of silver, and seven of musk, all inhabited by angels, and each country
ten thousand years' journey in length, and the same in breadth.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Some say that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>beyond it are creatures unknown to any but God:<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> but the general opinion is, that
the mountains of &#7730;&aacute;f terminate our earth, and that no one knows what is beyond
them. They are the chief abode of the Jinn, or Genii.&mdash;Such is a concise account of
the earth which we inhabit, according to the notions of the Arabs.</p>

<p>We must now describe what is <i>beneath</i> our earth.&mdash;It has already been said, that
this is the first, or highest, of seven earths, which are all of equal width and thickness,
and at equal distances apart. Each of these earths has occupants. The occupants of
the first are men, genii, brutes, &amp;c.: the second is occupied by the suffocating wind
that destroyed the infidel tribe of '&Aacute;d: the third, by the stones of Jahennem (or Hell),
mentioned in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, in these words, "the fuel of which is men and stones:"<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
the fourth, by the sulphur of Jahennem: the fifth, by its serpents: the sixth, by its
scorpions, in colour and size like black mules, and with tails like spears: the seventh,
by Iblees and his troops.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Whether these several earths are believed to be connected
with each other by any means, and if so, how, we are not expressly informed; but,
that they are supposed to be so is evident. With respect to our earth in particular,
as some think, it is said that it is supported by a rock, with which the mountains of
&#7730;&aacute;f communicate by means of veins or roots; and that, when God desires to effect an
earthquake at a certain place, He commands the mountain [or rock] to agitate the vein
that is connected with that place.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>&mdash;But there is another account, describing our
earth as upheld by certain successive supports of inconceivable magnitude, which are
under the seventh earth; leaving us to infer that the seven earths are in some
manner connected together. This account, as inserted in the work of one of the
writers above quoted, is as follows:&mdash;The earth [under which appellation are here
understood the seven earths] was, it is said, originally unstable; "therefore God
created an angel of immense size and of the utmost strength, and ordered him to go
beneath it, [<i>i.e.</i> beneath the lowest earth,] and place it on his shoulders; and his
hands extended beyond the east and west, and grasped the extremities of the earth [or,
as related in Ibn-El-Wardee, the seven earths], and held it [or them]. But there was
no support for his feet: so God created a rock of ruby, in which were seven thousand
perforations; and from each of these perforations issued a sea, the size of which none
knoweth but God, whose name be exalted: then He ordered this rock to stand under
the feet of the angel. But there was no support for the rock: wherefore God created
a huge bull, with four thousand eyes, and the same number of ears, noses, mouths,
tongues, and feet; between every two of which was a distance of five hundred years'
journey: and God, whose name be exalted, ordered this bull to go beneath the rock:
and he bore it on his back and his horns. The name of this bull is Kuyoot&agrave;.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> But
there was no support for the bull: therefore God, whose name be exalted, created
an enormous fish, that no one could look upon, on account of its vast size, and the
flashing of its eyes and their greatness; for it is said that if all the seas were placed
in one of its nostrils, they would appear like a grain of mustard-seed in the midst
of a desert: and God, whose name be exalted, commanded the fish to be a support
to the feet of the bull.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The name of this fish in Bahamoot. He placed, as its
support, water; and under the water, darkness: and the knowledge of mankind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>fails as to what is under the darkness."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>&mdash;Another opinion is, that the [seventh]
earth is upon water; the water, upon the rock; the rock, on the back of the bull;
the bull, on a bed of sand; the sand, on the fish; the fish, upon a still, suffocating
wind; the wind, on a veil of darkness; the darkness, on a mist; and what is beneath
the mist is unknown.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>It is generally believed, that, under the lowest earth, and beneath seas of darkness
of which the number is unknown, is Hell, which consists of seven stages, one beneath
another. The first of these, according to the general opinion, is destined for the reception
of wicked Mohammadans; the second, for the Christians; the third, for the Jews; the
fourth, for the Sabians; the fifth, for the Magians; the sixth, for the Idolaters; the
seventh, by general consent, for the Hypocrites. "Jahennem" is the general name
for Hell, and the particular name for its first stage. The situation of Hell has been a
subject of dispute; some place it in the seventh earth; and some have doubted whether
it be above or below the earth which <i>we</i> inhabit.</p>

<p>At the consummation of all things, God, we are told, will take the whole earth
in his [left] hand, and the heavens will be rolled together in his right hand;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and
the earth will be changed into another earth; and the heavens [into other heavens];<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
and Hell will be brought nigh [to the tribunal of God].<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro3" id="intro3">3.</a></span> The phrase "God is all-knowing," or "surpassing in knowledge," or, as
some say, simply "knowing," is generally used by an Arab writer when he relates anything
for the truth of which he cannot vouch; and Muslims often use it in conversation,
in similar cases, unless when they are uttering intentional falsehoods, which most of
them are in the frequent habit of doing. It is worthy of remark, that, though falsehood
is permitted by their religion in some cases, their doctors of religion and law generally
condemn all works of fiction (even though designed to convey useful instruction),
excepting mere fables, or apologues of a high class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro4" id="intro4">4.</a></span> In my usual standard-copy of the original work, as also in that from
which the old translation was made, and in the edition of Breslau, this prince is
called a king of the dynasty of S&aacute;s&aacute;n; but as he is not so designated in the Calcutta
edition of the first two hundred nights, I have here omitted, in my translation, what
would render the whole work full of anachronisms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro5" id="intro5">5.</a></span> Shahriy&aacute;r is a Persian word, signifying "Friend of the City." The
name of the elder King is thus written in the Calcutta edition above mentioned: in
the edition of Cairo (which I generally follow) it is written Shahrab&aacute;z, by errors in diacritical
marks; and in that of Breslau, Shahrab&aacute;n.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro6" id="intro6">6.</a></span> This name, Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n, is a compound of Persian and Arabic, and signifies
"King of the Age." By the omission of a diacritical point, in the Cairo edition, it
is written Sh&aacute;h-Rem&aacute;n.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro7" id="intro7">7.</a></span> In the Calcutta edition before mentioned, the elder brother is called King
of Samar&#7731;and; and the younger, King of China.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro8" id="intro8">8.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the title and office of</i> Wezeer. Wezeer is an Arabic word, and is pronounced
by the Arabs as I have written it; but the Turks and Persians pronounce
the first letter V. There are three opinions respecting the etymology of this word.
Some derive it from "wizr" (a burden); because the Wezeer bears the burdens of the
King: others, from "wezer" (a refuge); because the King has recourse to the counsels
of his Wezeer, and his knowledge and prudence: others, again, from "azr" (back, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>strength); because the King is strengthened by his Wezeer as the human frame is by
the back.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>The proper and chief duties of a Wezeer are explained by the above, and by a
saying of the Prophet:&mdash;"Whosoever is in authority over Muslims, if God would prosper
him, He giveth him a virtuous Wezeer, who, when he forgetteth his duty, remindeth
him, and when he remembereth, assisteth him: but if He would do otherwise, He
giveth him an evil Wezeer, who, when he forgetteth, doth not remind him, and when
he remembereth, doth not assist him."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>The post of Wezeer was the highest that was held by an officer of the pen; and
the person who occupied it was properly the next to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n: but the Turkish Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns
of Egypt made the office of N&aacute;&iuml;b (or Viceroy) to have the pre-eminence. Under them,
the post of Wezeer was sometimes occupied by an officer of the sword, and sometimes
by an officer of the pen; and, in both cases, the Wezeer was also called "the &#7778;&aacute;&#7717;eb."
The Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Bar&#7731;oo&#7731; so degraded this office, by intrusting its most important functions
to other ministers, that the Wezeer became, in reality, the King's purveyor, and little
else; receiving the indirect taxes, and employing them in the purchase of provisions
for the royal kitchen.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> It is even said, that he was usually chosen, by the Turkish
Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns of Egypt, from among the Copts (or Christian Egyptians); because the administration
of the taxes had, from time immemorial, been committed to persons of that
race.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> This, it would seem, was the case about the time of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Bar&#7731;oo&#7731;. But
in the present work, we are to understand the office of Wezeer as being what it was
in earlier times,&mdash;that of Prime Minister; though we are not hence to infer that the
editions of the Tales of a Thousand and One Nights known to us were written at a
period anterior to that of the Memlook Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns of Egypt and Syria; for, in the time
of these monarchs, the degradation of the office was commonly known to be a recent
innovation, and it may have been of no very long continuance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro9" id="intro9">9.</a></span> The paragraph to which this note relates is from the Calcutta edition of
the first two hundred Nights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro10" id="intro10">10.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Presents.</i> The custom of giving presents on the occasion of paying
a visit, or previously, which is of such high antiquity as to be mentioned in the book
of Genesis,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> has continued to prevail in the East to this day. Presents of provisions of
some kind, wax candles, &amp;c., are sent to a person about to celebrate any festivity, by
those who are to be his guests: but after paying a mere visit of ceremony, and on
some other occasions, only money is commonly given to the servants of the person
visited. In either case, the latter is expected to return the compliment on a similar
occasion by presents of equal value. To reject a present generally gives great offence;
being regarded as an insult to him who has offered it. When a person arrives from a
foreign country, he generally brings some articles of the produce or merchandise of
that country as presents to his friends. Thus, pilgrims returning from the holy places
bring water of Zemzem, dust from the Prophet's tomb, &amp;c., for this purpose.&mdash;Horses,
and male and female slaves, are seldom given but by kings or great men. Of the condition
of slaves in Mohammadan countries, an account will be given hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro11" id="intro11">11.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Letters of Muslims.</i> The letters of Muslims are distinguished by
several peculiarities dictated by the rules of politeness. The paper is thick, white, and
highly polished: sometimes it is ornamented with flowers of gold; and the edges are
always cut straight with scissors. The upper half is generally left blank: and the
writing never occupies any portion of the second side. A notion of the usual style of
letters will be conveyed by several examples in this work. The name of the person to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>whom the letter is addressed, when the writer is an inferior or an equal, and even in
some other cases, commonly occurs in the first sentence, preceded by several titles of
honour; and is often written a little above the line to which it apertains; the space
beneath it in that line being left blank: sometimes it is written in letters of gold, or
red ink. A king, writing to a subject, or a great man to a dependent, usually places
his name and seal at the head of his letter. The seal is the impression of a signet
(generally a ring, worn on the little finger of the right hand), upon which is engraved
the name of the person, commonly accompanied by the words "His [<i>i.e.</i> God's]
servant," or some other words expressive of trust in God, &amp;c. Its impression is considered
more valid than the sign-manual, and is indispensable to give authenticity to
the letter. It is made by dabbing some ink upon the surface of the signet, and pressing
this upon the paper: the place which is to be stamped being first moistened, by touching
the tongue with a finger of the right hand, and then gently rubbing the part with
that finger. A person writing to a superior, or to an equal, or even an inferior to
whom he wishes to shew respect, signs his name at the bottom of his letter, next the
left side or corner, and places the seal immediately to the right of this: but if he particularly
desire to testify his humility, he places it beneath his name, or even partly
over the lower edge of the paper, which consequently does not receive the whole of the
impression. The letter is generally folded twice, in the direction of the writing, and
enclosed in a cover of paper, upon which is written the address, in some such form as
this:&mdash;"It shall arrive, if it be the will of God, whose name be exalted, at such a place,
and be delivered into the hand of our honoured friend, &amp;c., such a one, whom God
preserve." Sometimes it is placed in a small bag, or purse, of silk embroidered with
gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro12" id="intro12">12.</a></span> The custom of sending forth a deputation to meet and welcome an approaching
ambassador, or other great man, is still observed in Eastern countries; and
the rank of the persons thus employed conveys to him some intimation of the manner
in which he is to be received at the court: he therefore looks forward to this ceremony
with a degree of anxiety. A humorous illustration of its importance in the eye of an
Oriental ambassador, is given in "The Adventures of Hajji Baba in England."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro13" id="intro13">13.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Hospitality.</i> The hospitable custom here mentioned is observed by
Muslims in compliance with a precept of their Prophet. "Whoever," said he, "believes
in God and the day of resurrection must respect his guest; and the time of being kind
to him is one day and one night; and the period of entertaining him is three days;
and after that, if he does it longer, he benefits him more; but it is not right for a
guest to stay in the house of the host so long as to incommode him." He even allowed
the "right of a guest" to be taken by force from such as would not offer it.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> The following
observations, respecting the treatment of guests by the Bedawees, present an
interesting commentary upon the former precept, and upon our text:&mdash;"Strangers who
have not any friend or acquaintance in the camp, alight at the first tent that presents
itself: whether the owner be at home or not, the wife or daughter immediately spreads
a carpet, and prepares breakfast or dinner. If the stranger's business requires a protracted
stay, as, for instance, if he wishes to cross the Desert under the protection of
the tribe, the host, after a lapse of three days and four hours from the time of his
arrival, asks whether he means to honour him any longer with his company. If the
stranger declares his intention of prolonging his visit, it is expected that he should
assist his host in domestic matters, fetching water, milking the camel, feeding the
horse, &amp;c. Should he even decline this, he may remain; but will be censured by all
the Arabs of the camp: he may, however, go to some other tent of the nezel [or encampment],
and declare himself there a guest. Thus, every third or fourth day he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>may change hosts, until his business is finished, or he has reached his place of destination."<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro14" id="intro14">14.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On different modes of Obeisance.</i> Various different modes of obeisance are
practised by the Muslims. Among these, the following are the more common or more
remarkable: they differ in the degree of respect that they indicate, nearly in the order
in which I shall mention them; the last being the most respectful:&mdash;1. Placing the
right hand upon the breast.&mdash;2. Touching the lips and the forehead or turban (or the
forehead or turban only) with the right hand.&mdash;3. Doing the same, but slightly inclining
the head during that action.&mdash;4. The same as the preceding, but inclining the body also.&mdash;5.
As above, but previously touching the ground with the right hand.&mdash;6. Kissing
the hand of the person to whom the obeisance is paid.&mdash;7. Kissing his sleeve.&mdash;8.
Kissing the skirt of his clothing.&mdash;9. Kissing his feet.&mdash;10. Kissing the carpet or
ground before him.&mdash;The first five modes are often accompanied by the salutation of
"Peace be on you!" to which the reply is, "On you be peace, and the mercy of God,
and his blessings!" The sixth mode is observed by servants or pupils to masters, by
the wife to the husband, and by children to their father, and sometimes to the mother.
It is also an act of homage paid to the aged by the young; or to learned or religious
men by the less instructed or less devout. The last mode is seldom observed but to
kings; and in Arabian countries it is now very uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro15" id="intro15">15.</a></span> It might seem unnecessary to say, that a King understood what he read,
were it not explained that the style of Arabic epistolary compositions, like that of the
literature in general, differs considerably from that of common conversation.</p>

in the palace of the king or governor, the inhabitants of an Eastern city are commanded
to decorate their houses, and the tradesmen, in particular, to adorn their shops,
by suspending shawls, brocades, rich dresses, women's ornaments, and all kinds of costly
articles of merchandise; lamps and flags are attached to cords drawn across the streets,
which are often canopied over; and when sufficient notice has been given, the shops,
and the doors, &amp;c., of private houses, are painted with gay colours.&mdash;Towards the close
of the year 1834, the people of Cairo were ordered to decorate their houses and shops
previously to the arrival of Ibr&aacute;heem B&aacute;sh&agrave;, after his victorious campaigns in Syria and
Asia Minor. They ornamented the lower parts of their houses with whitewash and red
ochre, generally in broad, alternate, horizontal stripes; that is, one course of stone
white, and the next red; but the only kind of oil-paint that they could procure in large
quantities was blue, the colour of mourning; so that they were obliged to use this as
the ground upon which to paint flowers and other ornamental devices on their shops;
but they regarded this as portending a pestilence; and the awful plague of the following
spring confirmed them in their superstitious notions.</p>

have some idea of the qualifications or charms which the Arabs in general consider
requisite to the perfection of female beauty; for erroneous fancies on this subject would
much detract from the interest of the present work. He must not imagine that
excessive fatness is one of these characteristics; though it is said to be esteemed a chief
essential to beauty throughout the greater part of Northern Africa: on the contrary,
the maiden whose loveliness inspires the most impassioned expressions in Arabic poetry
and prose is celebrated for her slender figure: she is like the cane among plants, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>is elegant as a twig of the oriental willow.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Her face is like the full moon, presenting
the strongest contrast to the colour of her hair, which (to preserve the nature of the
simile just employed,) is of the deepest hue of night, and descends to the middle of her
back. A rosy blush overspreads the centre of each cheek; and a mole is considered an
additional charm. The Arabs, indeed, are particularly extravagant in their admiration
of this natural beauty-spot; which, according to its place, is compared to a globule of
ambergris upon a dish of alabaster or upon the surface of a ruby.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> The eyes of the
Arab beauty are intensely black, large, and long; of the form of an almond: they are
full of brilliancy; but this is softened by a lid slightly depressed, and by long silken
lashes, giving a tender and languid expression, which is full of enchantment, and scarcely
to be improved by the adventitious aid of the black border of ko&#7717;l; for this the lovely
maiden adds rather for the sake of fashion than necessity; having, what the Arabs
term, natural ko&#7717;l. The eyebrows are thin and arched; the forehead is wide, and fair
as ivory; the nose, straight; the mouth, small; the lips are of a brilliant red; and the
teeth, "like pearls set in coral." The forms of the bosom are compared to two pomegranates;
the waist is slender; the hips are wide and large; the feet and hands, small;
the fingers, tapering, and their extremities dyed with the deep orange-red tint imparted
by the leaves of the &#7717;enn&agrave;.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The person in whom these charms are combined exhibits
a lively image of "the rosy-fingered Aurora:" her lover knows neither night nor sleep
in her presence, and the constellations of heaven are no longer seen by him when she
approaches. The most bewitching age is between fourteen and seventeen years; for
then the forms of womanhood are generally developed in their greatest beauty; but
many a maiden in her twelfth year possesses charms sufficient to fascinate every youth
or man who beholds her.</p>

<p>The reader may perhaps desire a more minute analysis of Arabian beauty. The
following is the most complete that I can offer him.&mdash;"Four things in a woman should
be <i>black</i>; the hair of the head, the eyebrows, the eyelashes, and the dark part of the
eyes: four <i>white</i>; the complexion of the skin, the white of the eyes, the teeth, and the
legs: four <i>red</i>; the tongue, the lips, the middle of the cheeks, and the gums: four
<i>round</i>; the head, the neck, the fore-arms, and the ankles: four <i>long</i>; the back, the
fingers, the arms, and the legs:<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> four <i>wide</i>; the forehead, the eyes, the bosom, and the
hips: four <i>fine</i>; the eyebrows, the nose, the lips, and the fingers: four <i>thick</i>; the lower
part of the back, the thighs, the calves of the legs, and the knees: four <i>small</i>; the ears,
the breasts, the hands, and the feet."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro21" id="intro21">21.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the</i> Jinn, <i>or Genii.</i> The frequent mention of Genii in this work, and
the erroneous accounts that have been given of these fabulous beings by various
European writers, have induced me to examine the statements respecting them in
several Arabic works; and I shall here offer the result of my investigation, with a
previous account of the Angels.</p>

<p>The Muslims, in general, believe in three different species of created intelligent
beings; namely, Angels, who are created of light; Genii, who are created of fire; and
Men, created of earth. The first species are called "Mel&aacute;ikeh" (sing. "Melek"); the
second, "Jinn" or "Ginn" (sing. "Jinnee" or "Ginnee"); the third, "Ins" (sing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>"Insee"). Some hold that the Devils (Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns) are of a species distinct from Angels
and Jinn; but the more prevailing opinion, and that which rests on the highest
authority, is, that they are rebellious Jinn.</p>

<p>"It is believed," says El-&#7730;azweenee, "that the Angels are of a simple substance,
endowed with life, and speech, and reason; and that the difference between them and
the Jinn and Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns is a difference of species. Know," he adds, "that the Angels
are sanctified from carnal desire and the disturbance of anger: they disobey not God in
what He hath commanded them, but do what they are commanded. Their food is the
celebrating of his glory; their drink, the proclaiming of his holiness; their conversation,
the commemoration of God, whose name be exalted; their pleasure, his worship: they
are created in different forms, and with different powers." Some are described as
having the forms of brutes. Four of them are Archangels; Jebraeel or Jibreel (or
Gabriel), the angel of revelations; Meekaeel or Meek&aacute;l (or Michael), the patron of the
Israelites; 'Azraeel, the angel of death; and Isr&aacute;feel, the angel of the trumpet, which
he is to sound twice, or as some say thrice, at the end of the world: one blast will kill
all living creatures (himself included): another, forty years after, (he being raised again
for this purpose, with Jebraeel and Meekaeel), will raise the dead. These Archangels
are also called Apostolic Angels. They are inferior in dignity to human prophets and
apostles, though superior to the rest of the human race: the angelic nature is held to
be inferior to the human nature, because all the Angels were commanded to prostrate
themselves before Adam. Every believer is attended by two guardian and recording
angels; one of whom writes his good actions; the other, his evil actions: or, according
to some, the number of these angels is five, or sixty, or a hundred and sixty. There
are also two Angels called Munkar (vulg. N&aacute;kir) and Nekeer, who examine all the dead,
and torture the wicked, in their graves.</p>

<p>The species of Jinn is said to have been created some thousands of years before
Adam. According to a tradition from the Prophet, this species consists of five orders
or classes; namely, J&aacute;nn (who are the least powerful of all), Jinn, Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns (or Devils),
'Efreets, and M&aacute;rids. The last, it is added, are the most powerful; and the J&aacute;nn are
transformed Jinn; like as certain apes and swine were transformed men.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>&mdash;It must,
however, be remarked here, that the terms Jinn and J&aacute;nn are generally used indiscriminately,
as names of the whole species (including the other orders above mentioned),
whether good or bad; and that the former term is the more common. Also, that
"Shey&#7789;&aacute;n" is commonly used to signify any evil Jinnee. An 'Efreet is a powerful
evil Jinnee:<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> a M&aacute;rid, an evil Jinnee of the most powerful class. The Jinn (but
generally speaking, evil ones) are called by the Persians "Deevs," the most powerful
evil Jinn, "Narahs" (which signifies "males," though they are said to be males and
females); the good Jinn, "Perees;" though this term is commonly applied to females.</p>

<p>In a tradition from the Prophet, it is said, "The J&aacute;nn were created of a smokeless
fire."<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> The word which signifies "a smokeless fire" has been misunderstood by some
as meaning "the flame of fire:" El-J&oacute;haree (in the &#7778;e&#7717;&aacute;&#7717;) renders it rightly; and
says that of this fire was <i>the</i> Shey&#7789;&aacute;n (Iblees) created. "El-J&aacute;nn" is sometimes used
as a name for Iblees; as in the following verse of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n:&mdash;"And the J&aacute;nn [the
father of the Jinn; <i>i. e.</i> Iblees] we had created before [<i>i. e.</i> before the creation of
Adam] of the fire of the samoom [<i>i. e.</i> of fire without smoke]."<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> "J&aacute;nn" also
signifies "a serpent;" as in other passages of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> and is used in the same
book as synonymous with "Jinn."<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> In the last sense it is generally believed to be
used in the tradition quoted in the commencement of this paragraph. There are several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>apparently contradictory traditions from the Prophet which are reconciled by what has
been above stated: in one, it is said, that Iblees was the father of all the J&aacute;nn and
Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> J&aacute;nn being here synonymous with Jinn: in another, that J&aacute;nn was the
father of all the Jinn;<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> here, J&aacute;nn being used as a name of Iblees.</p>

<p>"It is held," says El-&#7730;azweenee, "that the Jinn are aerial animals, with transparent
bodies, which can assume various forms. People differ in opinion respecting these
beings: some consider the Jinn and Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns as unruly men; but these persons are of
the Mo&#7841;tezileh [a sect of Muslim freethinkers]: and some hold, that God, whose name
be exalted, created the Angels of the light of fire, and the Jinn of its flame [but this is
at variance with the general opinion], and the Sheyt&aacute;ns of its smoke [which is also at
variance with the common opinion]; and that [all] these kinds of beings are [usually]
invisible<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> to men, but that they assume what forms they please, and when their form
becomes condensed they are visible."&mdash;This last remark illustrates several descriptions of
Jinnees in this work; where the form of the monster is at first undefined, or like an
enormous pillar, and then gradually assumes a human shape and less gigantic size.
The particular forms of brutes, reptiles, &amp;c., in which the Jinn most frequently appear
will be mentioned hereafter.</p>

<p>It is said that God created the J&aacute;nn [or Jinn] two thousand years before Adam [or,
according to some writers, much earlier]; and that there are believers and infidels and
every sect among them, as among men.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>&mdash;Some say that a prophet, named Yoosuf, was
sent to the Jinn: others, that they had only preachers, or admonishers: others, again,
that seventy apostles were sent, before Mo&#7717;ammad, to Jinn and men conjointly.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> It
is commonly believed that the preadamite Jinn were governed by forty (or, according
to some, seventy-two) kings, to each of whom the Arab writers give the name of
Suleym&aacute;n (or Solomon); and that they derive their appellation from the last of these,
who was called J&aacute;nn Ibn-J&aacute;nn, and who, some say, built the Pyramids of Egypt. The
following account of the preadamite Jinn is given by El-&#7730;azweenee.&mdash;"It is related in
histories, that a race of Jinn, in ancient times, before the creation of Adam, inhabited
the earth, and covered it, the land and the sea, and the plains and the mountains; and
the favours of God were multiplied upon them, and they had government, and prophecy,
and religion, and law; but they transgressed and offended, and opposed their prophets,
and made wickedness to abound in the earth; whereupon God, whose name be exalted,
sent against them an army of Angels, who took possession of the earth, and drove away
the Jinn to the regions of the islands, and made many of them prisoners; and of those
who were made prisoners was 'Az&aacute;zeel [afterwards called Iblees, from his <i>despair</i>]; and
a slaughter was made among them. At that time, 'Az&aacute;zeel was young: he grew up
among the Angels [and probably for that reason was called one of them], and became
learned in their knowledge, and assumed the government of them; and his days were
prolonged until he became their chief; and thus it continued for a long time, until the
affair between him and Adam happened, as God, whose name be exalted, hath said,
'When we said unto the Angels, Worship<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> ye Adam, and [all] worshipped except Iblees,
[who] was [one] of the Jinn.'"<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>"Iblees," we are told by another authority, "was sent as a governor upon the earth,
and judged among the Jinn a thousand years, after which he ascended into heaven, and
remained employed in worship until the creation of Adam."<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> The name of Iblees was
originally, according to some, 'Az&aacute;zeel (as before mentioned); and according to others,
El-&#7716;&aacute;rith: his patronymic is Aboo-Murrah, or Abu-l-Ghimr.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>&mdash;It is disputed whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>he was of the Angels or of the Jinn. There are three opinions on this point.&mdash;1. That
he was of the Angels, from a tradition from Ibn-'Abb&aacute;s.&mdash;2. That he was of the
Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns (or evil Jinn); as it is said in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, "except Iblees, [who] was [one] of
the Jinn:" this was the opinion of El-&#7716;asan El-Ba&#7779;ree, and is that commonly held.&mdash;3.
That he was neither of the Angels nor of the Jinn; but created alone, of fire.&mdash;Ibn-'Abb&aacute;s
founds his opinion on the same text from which El-&#7716;asan El-Ba&#7779;ree derives his:
"When we said unto the Angels, Worship ye Adam, and [all] worshipped except Iblees,
[who] was [one] of the Jinn" (before quoted): which he explains by saying, that the
most noble and honourable among the Angels are called "the Jinn," because they are
<i>veiled</i> from the eyes of the other Angels on account of their superiority; and that Iblees
was one of these Jinn. He adds, that he had the government of the lowest heaven and
of the earth, and was called the &#7788;&aacute;oos (literally, Peacock) of the Angels; and that there
was not a spot in the lowest heaven but he had prostrated himself upon it: but
when the Jinn rebelled upon the earth, God sent a troop of Angels who drove them to
the islands and mountains; and Iblees being elated with pride, and refusing to prostrate
himself before Adam, God transformed him into a Shey&#7789;&aacute;n.&mdash;But this reasoning is opposed
by other verses, in which Iblees is represented as saying, "Thou hast created <i>me</i>
of <i>fire</i>, and hast created <i>him</i> [Adam] of <i>earth</i>."<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> It is therefore argued, "If he were
created originally of fire, how was he created of light? for the Angels were [all] created
of light."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>&mdash;The former verse may be explained by the tradition, that Iblees, having
been taken captive, was exalted among the Angels; or perhaps there is an ellipsis after
the word "Angels;" for it might be inferred that the command given to the Angels
was also (and <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>) to be obeyed by the Jinn.</p>

<p>According to a tradition, Iblees and all the Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns are distinguished from the
other Jinn by a longer existence. "The Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns," it is added, "are the children of
Iblees, and die not but with him: whereas the [other] Jinn die before him;"<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> though
they may live many centuries. But this is not altogether accordant with the popular
belief: Iblees and many other evil Jinn are to survive mankind; but they are to die
before the general resurrection; as also even the Angels; the last of whom will be the
Angel of Death, 'Azraeel: yet not <i>all</i> the evil Jinn are to live thus long: many of them
are killed by shooting stars, hurled at them from heaven; wherefore, the Arabs, when
they see a shooting star (shih&aacute;b), often exclaim, "May God transfix the enemy of the
faith!"&mdash;Many also are killed by other Jinn; and some, even by men. The fire of
which the Jinnee is created circulates in his veins, in place of blood: therefore, when
he receives a mortal wound, this fire, issuing from his veins, generally consumes him
to ashes.&mdash;The Jinn, it has been already shown, are peccable. They also eat and drink,
and propagate their species, sometimes in conjunction with human beings; in which
latter case, the offspring partakes of the nature of both parents. In all these respects
they differ from the Angels. Among the evil Jinn are distinguished the five sons of
their chief, Iblees; namely, Teer, who brings about calamities, losses, and injuries; El-A&#7841;war,
who encourages debauchery; S&oacute;&#7789;, who suggests lies; D&aacute;sim, who causes hatred
between man and wife; and Zelemboor, who presides over places of traffic.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>The most common forms and habitations or places of resort of the Jinn must now be
described.</p>

<p>The following traditions from the Prophet are the most to the purpose that I have
seen.&mdash;The Jinn are of various shapes; having the forms of serpents, scorpions, lions,
wolves, jackals, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>&mdash;The Jinn are of three kinds; one on the land; one in the sea;
and one in the air.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> The Jinn consist of forty troops; each troop consisting of six
hundred thousand.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>&mdash;The Jinn are of three kinds; one have wings, and fly; another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>are snakes, and dogs; and the third move about from place to place like men.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>&mdash;Domestic
snakes are asserted to be Jinn on the same authority.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>The Prophet ordered his followers to kill serpents and scorpions if they intruded
at prayers; but on other occasions, he seems to have required first to admonish them
to depart, and then, if they remained, to kill them. The Doctors, however, differ in
opinion whether <i>all</i> kinds of snakes or serpents should be admonished first; or whether
<i>any</i> should; for the Prophet, say they, took a covenant of the Jinn [probably after
the above-mentioned command], that they should not enter the houses of the faithful:
therefore, it is argued, if they enter, they break their covenant, and it becomes lawful to
kill them without previous admonishment. Yet it is related that '&Aacute;isheh, the Prophet's
wife, having killed a serpent in her chamber, was alarmed by a dream, and, fearing
that it might have been a Muslim Jinnee, as it did not enter her chamber when she
was undressed, gave in alms, as an expiation, twelve thousand dirhems (about &pound;300),
the price of the blood of a Muslim.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>The Jinn are said to appear to mankind most commonly in the shapes of serpents,
dogs, cats, or human beings. In the last case, they are sometimes of the stature of
men, and sometimes of a size enormously gigantic. If good, they are generally resplendently
handsome: if evil, horribly hideous. They become invisible at pleasure
(by a rapid extension or rarefaction of the particles which compose them), or suddenly
disappear in the earth or air, or through a solid wall. Many Muslims in the present
day profess to have seen and held intercourse with them.</p>

<p>The Z&oacute;ba'ah, which is a whirlwind that raises the sand or dust in the form of a pillar
of prodigious height, often seen sweeping across the deserts and fields, is believed to
be caused by the flight of an evil Jinnee. To defend themselves from a Jinnee thus
"riding in the whirlwind," the Arabs often exclaim, "Iron! Iron!" (&#7716;adeed! &#7716;adeed!),
or, "Iron! thou unlucky!" (&#7716;adeed! y&aacute; mashoom!), as the Jinn are supposed to have
a great dread of that metal: or they exclaim, "God is most great!" (All&aacute;hu akbar!).<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
A similar superstition prevails with respect to the water-spout at sea, as the reader may
have discovered from the first instance of the description of a Jinnee in the present
work, which occasions this note to be here inserted.</p>

<p>It is believed that the chief abode of the Jinn is in the Mountains of &#7730;&aacute;f, which
are supposed (as mentioned on a former occasion) to encompass the whole of our earth.
But they are also believed to pervade the solid body of our earth, and the firmament;
and to choose, as their principal places of resort, or of occasional abode, baths, wells,
the latrina, ovens, ruined houses, market-places, the junctures of roads, the sea, and
rivers. The Arabs, therefore, when they pour water, &amp;c., on the ground, or enter a
bath, or let down a bucket into a well, or visit the latrina, and on various other occasions,
say, "Permission!" or "Permission, ye blessed!" (Destoor! or, Destoor y&aacute; mub&aacute;rakeen!").<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>&mdash;The
evil spirits (or evil Jinn), it is said, had liberty to enter any of the
seven heavens till the birth of Jesus, when they were excluded from three of them;
on the birth of Mo&#7717;ammad, they were forbidden the other four.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> They continue,
however, to ascend to the confines of the lowest heaven, and there listening to the
conversation of the Angels respecting things decreed by God, obtain knowledge of
futurity, which they sometimes impart to men, who, by means of talismans, or certain
invocations, make them to serve the purposes of magical performances. To this particular
subject it will be necessary to revert.&mdash;What the Prophet said of Iblees, in the
following tradition, applies also to the evil Jinn over whom he presides:&mdash;His chief
abode [among men] is the bath; his chief places of resort are the markets, and the
junctures of roads; his food is whatever is killed without the name of God being
pronounced over it; his drink, whatever is intoxicating; his mu&euml;ddin, the mizm&aacute;r (a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>musical pipe; <i>i. e.</i> any musical instrument); his &#7731;ur&aacute;n, poetry; his written character,
the marks made in geomancy;<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> his speech, falsehood; his snares are women.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>That particular Jinnees presided over particular places, was an opinion of the early
Arabs. It is said in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, "And there were certain men who sought refuge with
certain of the Jinn."<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> In the Commentary of the Jel&aacute;leyn, I find the following remark
on these words:&mdash;"When they halted, on their journey, in a place of fear, each man
said, 'I seek refuge with the lord of this place, from the mischief of his foolish ones!'"
In illustration of this, I may insert the following tradition, translated from El-&#7730;azweenee:&mdash;"It
is related by a certain narrator of traditions, that he descended into
a valley, with his sheep, and a wolf carried off a ewe from among them; and he arose,
and raised his voice, and cried, 'O inhabitant of the valley!' whereupon he heard a
voice saying, 'O wolf, restore to him his sheep!' and the wolf came with the ewe, and
left her, and departed."&mdash;The same opinion is held by the modern Arabs, though
probably they do not use such an invocation.&mdash;A similar superstition, a relic of ancient
Egyptian credulity, still prevails among the people of Cairo. It is believed that each
quarter of this city has its peculiar guardian-genius, or Agathod&aelig;mon, which has the
form of a serpent.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that some of the Jinn are Muslims; and others,
infidels. The good Jinn acquit themselves of the imperative duties of religion; namely,
prayers, alms-giving, fasting during the month of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, and pilgrimage to Mekkeh
and Mount 'Araf&aacute;t: but in the performance of these duties they are generally invisible
to human beings. Some examples of the mode in which good Jinn pay the alms required
of them by the law, I have given in a former work.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>Of the services and injuries done by Jinn to men, some account must be given.</p>

<p>It has been stated, that, by means of talismans, or certain invocations, men are said
to obtain the services of Jinn; and the manner in which the latter are enabled to assist
magicians, by imparting to them the knowledge of future events, has been explained.
No man ever obtained such absolute power over the Jinn as Suleym&aacute;n, Ibn-D&aacute;ood
(Solomon, the Son of David). This he did by virtue of a most wonderful talisman, which
is said to have come down to him from heaven. It was a seal-ring, upon which was
engraved "the most great name" of God; and was partly composed of brass, and partly
of iron. With the brass he stamped his written commands to the good Jinn; with the
iron (for a reason before mentioned), those to the evil Jinn, or Devils. Over both orders
he had unlimited power; as well as over the birds and the winds,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and, as is generally
said, the wild beasts. His Wezeer, A&#7779;af the son of Barkhiy&agrave;, is also said to have been
acquainted with "the most great name," by uttering which, the greatest miracles may
be performed; even that of raising the dead. By virtue of this name, engraved on his
ring, Suleym&aacute;n compelled the Jinn to assist in building the Temple of Jerusalem, and
in various other works. Many of the evil Jinn he converted to the true faith; and
many others of this class, who remained obstinate in infidelity, he confined in prisons.
He is said to have been monarch of the whole earth. Hence, perhaps, the name of
Suleym&aacute;n is given to the universal monarchs of the preadamite Jinn; unless the story
of his own universal dominion originated from confounding him with those kings of the
Jinn.</p>

<p>The injuries related to have been inflicted upon human beings by evil Jinn are of
various kinds. Jinnees are said to have often carried off beautiful women, whom they
have forcibly kept as their wives or concubines. I have mentioned in a former work,
that malicious or disturbed Jinnees are asserted often to station themselves on the roofs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>or at the windows, of houses, and to throw down bricks and stones on persons passing
by.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> When they take possession of an uninhabited house, they seldom fail to persecute
terribly any person who goes to reside in it. They are also very apt to pilfer provisions,
&amp;c. Many learned and devout persons, to secure their property from such
depredations, repeat the words "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful!"
on locking the doors of their houses, rooms, or closets, and on covering the bread-basket,
or anything containing food.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> During the month of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, the evil Jinn are believed
to be confined in prison; and therefore, on the last night of that month, with the
same view, women sometimes repeat the words above mentioned, and sprinkle salt upon
the floors of the apartments of their houses.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>To complete this sketch of Arabian mythology, an account must be added of several
creatures generally believed to be of inferior orders of the Jinn.</p>

<p>One of these is the Ghool, which is commonly regarded as a kind of Sheyt&aacute;n, or evil
Jinnee, that eats men; and is also described by some as a Jinnee or an enchanter who
assumes various forms. The Ghools are said to appear in the forms of various animals,
and of human beings, and in many monstrous shapes; to haunt burial-grounds and other
sequestered spots; to feed upon dead human bodies; and to kill and devour any human
creature who has the misfortune to fall in their way: whence the term "Ghool" is
applied to any cannibal. An opinion quoted by a celebrated author, respecting the
Ghool, is, that it is a demoniacal animal, which passes a solitary existence in the deserts,
resembling both man and brute; that it appears to a person travelling alone in the
night and in solitary places, and, being supposed by him to be itself a traveller, lures
him out of his way.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Another opinion stated by him is this: that, when the Sheyt&aacute;ns
attempt to hear words by stealth [from the confines of the lowest heaven], they are
struck by shooting stars; and some are burnt; some, falling into a sea, or rather a large
river (ba&#7717;r), become converted into crocodiles; and some, falling upon the land, become
Ghools. The same author adds the following tradition:&mdash;"The Ghool is any Jinnee that
is opposed to travels, assuming various forms and appearances;"<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> and affirms that
several of the Companions of the Prophet saw Ghools in their travels; and that 'Omar,
among them, saw a Ghool while on a journey to Syria, before El-Isl&aacute;m, and struck it
with his sword.&mdash;It appears that "Ghool" is, properly speaking, a name only given to a
<i>female</i> demon of the kind above described: the male is called "&#7730;u&#7789;rub."<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> It is said
that these beings, and the Ghadd&aacute;r, or Gharr&aacute;r, and other similar creatures which will
presently be mentioned, are the offspring of Iblees and of a wife whom God created for
him of the fire of the Samoom (which here signifies, as in an instance before mentioned,
"a smokeless fire"); and that they sprang from an egg.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> The female Ghool, it is
added, appears to men in the deserts, in various forms, converses with them, and sometimes
prostitutes herself to them.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>The Se&#7841;l&aacute;h, or Sa&#7841;l&aacute;h, is another demoniacal creature, described by some [or rather,
by most authors] as of the Jinn. It is said that it is mostly found in forests, and that
when it captures a man, it makes him dance, and plays with him as the cat plays with
the mouse. A man of I&#7779;fah&aacute;n asserted that many beings of this kind abounded in
his country; that sometimes the wolf would hunt one of them by night, and devour
it, and that, when it had seized it, the Se&#7841;l&aacute;h would cry out, "Come to my help, for
the wolf devoureth me!" or it would cry, "Who will liberate me? I have a hundred
deen&aacute;rs, and he shall receive them!" but the people knowing that it was the cry of
the Se&#7841;l&aacute;h, no one would liberate it; and so the wolf would eat it.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>&mdash;An island in the
sea of E&#7779;-&#7778;een (or China) is called "the Island of the Se&#7841;l&aacute;h," by Arab geographers,
from its being said to be inhabited by the demons so named: they are described as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>creatures of hideous forms, supposed to be Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns, the offspring of human beings and
Jinn, who eat men."<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>The Ghadd&aacute;r, or Gharr&aacute;r (for its name is written differently in two different MSS.
in my possession), is another creature of a similar nature, described as being found in
the borders of El-Yemen, and sometimes in Tih&aacute;meh, and in the upper parts of Egypt.
It is said that it entices a man to it, and either tortures him in a manner not to be
described, or merely terrifies him, and leaves him.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>The Delh&aacute;n is also a demoniacal being, inhabiting the islands of the seas, having
the form of a man, and riding on an ostrich. It eats the flesh of men whom the sea
casts on the shore from wrecks. Some say that a Delh&aacute;n once attacked a ship in the
sea, and desired to take the crew; but they contended with it; whereupon it uttered
a cry which caused them to fall upon their faces, and it took them.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>&mdash;In my MS. of
Ibn-El-Wardee, I find the name written "Dahl&aacute;n." He mentions an island called by
this name, in the Sea of 'Om&aacute;n; and describes its inhabitants as cannibal Shey&#7789;&aacute;ns,
like men in form, and riding on birds resembling ostriches.</p>

<p>The Shi&#7731;&#7731; is another demoniacal creature, having the form of half a human being
(like a man divided longitudinally); and it is believed that the Nesn&aacute;s is the offspring
of a Shi&#7731;&#7731; and of a human being. The Shi&#7731;&#7731; appears to travellers; and it was a
demon of this kind who killed, and was killed by, 'Al&#7731;amah, the son of &#7778;afw&aacute;n, the
son of Umeiyeh; of whom it is well known that he was killed by a Jinnee. So says
El-&#7730;azweenee.</p>

<p>The Nesn&aacute;s (above mentioned) is described as resembling half a human being;
having half a head, half a body, one arm, and one leg, with which it hops with much
agility; as being found in the woods of El-Yemen, and being endowed with speech:
"but God," it is added, "is all-knowing."<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> It is said that it is found in &#7716;a&#7693;ram&oacute;t
as well as El-Yemen; and that one was brought alive to El-Mutawekkil: it resembled
a man in form, excepting that it had but half a face, which was in its breast,
and a tail like that of a sheep. The people of &#7716;a&#7693;ram&oacute;t, it is added, eat it; and
its flesh is sweet. It is only generated in their country. A man who went there
asserted that he saw a captured Nesn&aacute;s, which cried out for mercy, conjuring him by
God and by himself.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> A race of people whose head is in the breast is described as
inhabiting an island called J&aacute;beh (supposed to be Java), in the Sea of El-Hind, or
India.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> A kind of Nesn&aacute;s is also described as inhabiting the Island of R&aacute;&iuml;j, in the Sea
of E&#7779;-&#7778;een, or China, and having wings like those of the bat.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>The H&aacute;tif is a being that is heard, but not seen; and is often mentioned by Arab
writers. It is generally the communicator of some intelligence in the way of advice, or
direction, or warning.</p>

<p>Here terminating this long note, I must beg the reader to remark, that the superstitious
fancies which it describes are prevalent among all classes of the Arabs, and
the Muslims in general, learned as well as vulgar. I have comprised in it much matter
not necessary to illustrate the introductory portion of this work, in order to avoid
frequent recurrence to the same subject. Another apology for its length may also be
offered:&mdash;its importance as confuting Schlegel's opinion, that the frequent mention of
Genii is more consistent with Indian than with Arab notions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro27" id="intro27">27.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the wickedness of Women.</i> The wickedness of women is a subject upon
which the stronger sex among the Arabs, with an affected feeling of superior virtue,
often dwell in common conversation. That women are deficient in judgment or good
sense is held as a fact not to be disputed even by themselves, as it rests on an assertion
of the Prophet; but that they possess a superior degree of cunning is pronounced
equally certain and notorious. Their general depravity is pronounced to be much
greater than that of men. "I stood," said the Prophet, "at the gate of Paradise;
and lo, most of its inmates were the poor: and I stood at the gate of Hell; and lo,
most of its inmates were women."<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> In allusion to women, the Khaleefeh 'Omar said,
"Consult them, and do the contrary of what they advise." But this is not to be done
merely for the sake of opposing them; nor when other advice can be had. "It is
desirable for a man," says a learned Im&aacute;m, "before he enters upon any important
undertaking, to consult ten intelligent persons among his particular friends; or, if
he have not more than five such friends, let him consult each of them twice; or, if
he have not more than one friend, he should consult him ten times, at ten different
visits: if he have not one to consult, let him return to his wife, and consult her;
and whatever she advises him to do, let him do the contrary: so shall he proceed
rightly in his affair, and attain his object."<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> A truly virtuous wife is, of course,
excepted in this rule: such a person is as much respected by Muslims as she is (at
least, according to their own account) rarely met with by them. When woman was
created, the Devil, we are told, was delighted, and said, "Thou art half of my host,
and thou art the depository of my secret, and thou art my arrow, with which I shoot,
and miss not."<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> What are termed by us affairs of gallantry were very common
among the Pagan Arabs, and are scarcely less so among their Muslim posterity. They
are, however, unfrequent among most tribes of Bedawees, and among the descendants
of those tribes not long settled as cultivators. I remember being roused from the quiet
that I generally enjoyed in an ancient tomb in which I resided at Thebes, by the cries
of a young woman in the neighbourhood, whom an Arab was severely beating for an
impudent proposal that she had made to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro28" id="intro28">28.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the cruelty ascribed to</i> Shahriy&aacute;r. I wish that I could accuse the
author of inventing, in this case, an incident of an incredible nature, and entirely
unparalleled; but, alas, acts of equal cruelty are recorded of Arab princes: traits of
benevolence, and crimes of the blackest hue, are related in their histories, sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>in the same page. I have not read of any case exactly resembling that to which this
note relates; but the following anecdote will shew, that if conduct still more atrocious
had been described in the latter, it might have been founded on fact. "In the year of
the Flight 423, the Khaleefeh of Egypt, E&#7827;-&#7826;&aacute;hir, the son of El-&#7716;&aacute;kim, collected
together all the female slaves that were in the palace, and said to them, 'Assemble
together, and I will make a day of pleasure for you, such as hath not before been seen
in Egypt.' He ordered, also, that every person who had a female slave should bring
her, and that none of them should come but with her ornaments of jewels and gold.
They did so; and there was not a single one that did not come. He then placed them
in a chamber, and, calling some masons, made them build up the door of the chamber
upon them, and so they all died. This happened on Friday (the Mohammadan
Sabbath,) the 6th of Showw&aacute;l. The number of them was two thousand six hundred
and sixty female slaves. After they had remained six months, he heaped lighted combustibles
upon them, and burned them, together with their clothes and ornaments.
May God [says the narrator] shew no mercy to him!"<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro29" id="intro29">29.</a></span> I here deviate a little from my original, in which Shahraz&aacute;d is made to
say, "Either I shall live, or I shall be a ransom for the daughters of the Muslims, and
the cause of their deliverance from him." Upon this, the sheykh Mo&#7717;ammed 'Eiy&aacute;d
has remarked in a marginal note, "It would seem that she had contrived some stratagem
to prevent his marrying again if he determined to kill her: otherwise, the mere killing
her would not be a means of rescuing the other maidens."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro30" id="intro30">30.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Language of Birds, &amp;c.</i> It is commonly believed by the Muslims
(learned and unlearned), that all kinds of birds, and many (if not all) beasts, have a
language by which they communicate their thoughts to each other; and we are told in
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> that Suleym&aacute;n (or Solomon) was taught the language of birds.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> I
thought that I could boast of an accomplishment very rare in Christian countries, in
having learned, in Egypt, somewhat of this language; for instance, that the common
cry of the pigeon is "All&aacute;h! All&aacute;h!" ("God! God!"); that of the ringdove, "Keerem!
Toww&aacute;b!" ("Bountiful! Propitious!"&mdash;an ejaculation addressed to God); that of the
common dove, "Wa&#7717;&#7717;idoo rabbakumu-llezee khala&#7731;akum, yeghfir-lakum zembakum!"
("Assert the unity of your Lord who created you, so will He forgive you your sin!")
but I afterwards found that several specimens of this language were given by Ez-Zamakhsheree,
and had been published in Europe: see "Alcoranus Marraccii," p. 511.
The cock cries, "Uzkuru-ll&aacute;ha, y&aacute; gh&aacute;filoon!" ("Commemorate God, O ye negligent!"):
the &#7731;a&#7789;&agrave; (a kind of grouse),<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> "Men seket selim!" ("He who is silent is safe!"). The
latter, however, would do better if it did itself attend to the maxim it utters; for its
cry, which, to the uninstructed in the language of birds, sounds merely, "&#7731;a&#7789;&agrave;! &#7731;a&#7789;&agrave;!"

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro31" id="intro31">31.</a></span> In the houses of persons of the middle classes in Arabian countries, there
is generally an apartment on the ground-floor fitted up as a stable for a horse, mule,
or ass, or for two or more such animals; and the cattle of the farmer, if not very
numerous, are usually lodged during the night in similar quarters, or in an open court
enclosed within, or immediately adjacent to, his house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro32" id="intro32">32.</a></span> It is a common custom in the East to sprinkle the ground, during the
summer, in order to cool the air.</p>

dictated by an indispensable rule of Muslim politeness, which requires that these or
some similar words should be uttered by a person whenever he sees another with food
before him, and does not partake of it. If this were not done, it would be feared that
the food had been poisoned, or rendered of no avail, by an envious eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro35" id="intro35">35.</a></span> The peasants in the East use a hand-mill for grinding their corn. The
larger mills used for this and other purposes are turned by cattle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro36" id="intro36">36.</a></span> In the Calcutta edition of the first two hundred nights, the ass is made
to quote verses to the bull. Hast thou not, he asks him, heard the poet say:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro37" id="intro37">37.</a></span> I read "na&#7789;'an," as in the Calcutta edition of the first two hundred nights,
instead of "ki&#7789;a'an" in the Cairo edition. The na&#7789;&#7841; is a large round piece of leather,
which, spread upon the ground, serves as a table for dinner, &amp;c. It is particularly convenient,
and therefore much used, in travelling. Around the edge is a running string,
which, being drawn, converts it into a bag to hold what is left of the food.</p>

passes sentence in all cases of law, religious, moral, civil, and criminal. This he generally
does, in the present day, in accordance with the decision of a Muftee, or doctor
of the law. In small towns and villages, he is often employed to draw up written
contracts of various kinds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro40" id="intro40">40.</a></span> To perform the ablution preparatory to prayer in the expectation of
almost immediate death, is a supererogatory act which, I believe, is seldom observed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="intro41" id="intro41">41.</a></span> Both religion and climate make the Muslim an early riser. It is his
duty to perform the first of the five daily prayers at, or soon after, daybreak; and he
generally awakes before this period. While Shahriy&aacute;r, therefore, was waiting for the
dawn of day to acquit himself of this duty, in accordance with the common custom of
Mohammadan kings, Shahraz&aacute;d amused him by the recitation of her tales. That he
should be described as thus strict with regard to religious exercises, when about to give
orders for the murder of his innocent wife, needs not excite our surprise: such conduct
is consistent with the character of many Muslims. In the year 1834, when I was residing
in Cairo, a General in the service of Mo&#7717;ammad 'Alee hired a large party of men
to perform a recital of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, in his house in that city, and then went up into his
&#7717;areem, and strangled his wife, in consequence of a report which accused her of incontinence.
The religious ceremony was designed as preparatory to this act, though the
punishment of the woman was contrary to the law, since her husband neither produced
four witnesses of the imputed crime, nor allowed her to clear herself of the charge by
her own oath. Another case of diligence in the performance of a religious duty, accompanied
by the contemplation of murder, but murder on a larger scale, occurred in
the same city shortly after. Suleym&aacute;n &Aacute;gh&agrave;, the Sil&aacute;&#7717;d&aacute;r, being occupied in directing
the building of a public fountain, as a work of charity to place to the account of a
deceased brother, desired to extend the original plan of the structure; and to do this, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>was necessary that he should purchase two houses adjoining the plot in which the
foundations had been laid: but the owners of these houses refused to sell them, and he
therefore employed a number of workmen to undermine them by night, and cause them
to fall upon their inhabitants. His scheme, however, but partially succeeded, and no
lives were sacrificed. This man was notorious for cruelty, but he was a person of
pleasing and venerable countenance, and engaging manners: whenever I chanced to
meet him, I received from him a most gracious salutation. He died before I quitted
Egypt.</p>

These numbers agree (excepting in a few cases,
where a disagreement was found absolutely necessary)
with those in Hinckelmann's edition, which
is that most commonly quoted by the learned. I
am sorry to see that Marracci's numbers have been
adopted in a late edition of Sale's translation, and
that the distinction between the words of the text
and the explanatory interpolations has there been
neglected. Its utility to Arabic scholars, and its
general fidelity, have been thus greatly lessened;
and it appears to me very desirable that it should
be superseded as soon as possible by another
edition.</p></div>

"Kath&aacute; Sarit S&aacute;gara," is a story which may have
been the original of that to which this note refers.
"Two young Brahmans travelling are benighted
in a forest, and take up their lodging in a tree
near a lake. Early in the night a number of
people come from the water, and having made
preparation for an entertainment, retire; a Yaksha,
a genie, then comes out of the lake with his two
wives, and spends the night there: when he and
one of his wives are asleep, the other, seeing the
youths, invites them to approach her, and to encourage
them, shews them a hundred rings received
from former gallants, notwithstanding her
husband's precautions, who keeps her locked up
in a chest at the bottom of the lake. The Hindu
story-teller is more moral than the Arab. The
youths reject her advances; she wakes the genie,
who is going to put them to death, but the rings
are produced in evidence against the unfaithful
wife, and she is turned away with the loss of her
nose. The story is repeated in the next section
with some variation; the lady has ninety and nine
rings, and is about to complete the hundredth,
when her husband, who is here a Naga, a snake-god,
wakes, and consumes the guilty pair with fire
from his mouth."&mdash;British and Foreign Review,

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h6>COMMENCING WITH THE FIRST NIGHT, AND ENDING WITH PART OF THE THIRD.</h6>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE MERCHANT AND THE JINNEE.</h5>

<p>It has been related to me, O happy King, said Shahraz&aacute;d, that
there was a certain merchant who had great wealth, and traded
extensively with surrounding countries; and one day he mounted his
horse, and journeyed to a neighbouring country to collect what was
due to him, and, the heat oppressing him, he sat under a tree, in a
garden,<a href="#I1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and put his hand into his saddle-bag,<a href="#I2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and ate a morsel of
bread and a date which were among his provisions. Having eaten
the date, he threw aside the stone,<a href="#I3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and immediately there appeared
before him an 'Efreet, of enormous height, who, holding a drawn
sword in his hand, approached him, and said, Rise, that I may kill
thee, as thou hast killed my son. The merchant asked him, How
have I killed thy son? He answered, When thou atest the date, and
threwest aside the stone, it struck my son upon the chest,<a href="#I4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and, as
fate had decreed against him, he instantly died.<a href="#I5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f22" id="f22"></a><img src="images/fig22.png" width="550" height="733" alt="Merchant and Jinnee" title="Merchant and Jinnee" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>The merchant, on hearing these words,<a href="#I6" class="fnanchor">6</a> exclaimed, Verily to God
we belong, and verily to Him we must return! There is no strength
nor power but in God, the High, the Great! If I killed him, I did
it not intentionally, but without knowing it; and I trust in thee that
thou wilt pardon me.&mdash;The Jinnee answered, Thy death is indispensable,
as thou hast killed my son:&mdash;and so saying, he dragged him,
and threw him on the ground, and raised his arm to strike him
with the sword. The merchant, upon this, wept bitterly, and said
to the Jinnee, I commit my affair unto God, for no one can avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
what He hath decreed:&mdash;and he continued his lamentation, repeating
the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Time consists of two days; this, bright; and that, gloomy: and life, of two moieties; this, safe; and that, fearful.</span>
<span class="i0">Say to him who hath taunted us on account of misfortunes, Doth fortune oppose any but the eminent?</span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou not observe that corpses float upon the sea, while the precious pearls remain in its furthest depths?</span>
<span class="i0">When the hands of time play with us, misfortune is imparted to us by its protracted kiss.</span>
<span class="i0">In the heaven are stars that cannot be numbered; but none is eclipsed save the sun and the moon.</span>
<span class="i0">How many green and dry trees are on the earth; but none is assailed with stones save that which beareth fruit!</span>
<span class="i0">Thou thoughtest well of the days when they went well with thee, and fearedst not the evil that destiny was bringing.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;When he had finished reciting these verses, the Jinnee said to him,
Spare thy words, for thy death is unavoidable.</p>

<p>Then said the merchant, Know, O 'Efreet, that I have debts to
pay, and I have much property, and children, and a wife, and I have
pledges also in my possession: let me, therefore, go back to my
house, and give to every one his due, and then I will return to thee: I
bind myself by a vow and covenant that I will return to thee, and
thou shalt do what thou wilt; and God is witness of what I say.&mdash;Upon
this, the Jinnee accepted his covenant, and liberated him;
granting him a respite until the expiration of the year.</p>

<p>The merchant, therefore, returned to his town, accomplished all
that was upon his mind to do, paid every one what he owed him, and
informed his wife and children of the event which had befallen him;
upon hearing which, they and all his family and women wept. He
appointed a guardian over his children, and remained with his family
until the end of the year; when he took his grave-clothes under his
arm,<a href="#I7" class="fnanchor">7</a> bade farewell to his household and neighbours, and all his
relations, and went forth, in spite of himself; his family raising cries
of lamentation, and shrieking.<a href="#I8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>He proceeded until he arrived at the garden before mentioned;
and it was the first day of the new year; and as he sat, weeping for
the calamity which he expected soon to befall him, a sheykh,<a href="#I9" class="fnanchor">9</a> advanced
in years, approached him, leading a gazelle with a chain attached to
its neck. This sheykh saluted the merchant, wishing him a long
life, and said to him, What is the reason of thy sitting alone in this
place, seeing that it is a resort of the Jinn? The merchant therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
informed him of what had befallen him with the 'Efreet, and of the
cause of his sitting there; at which the sheykh, the owner of the
gazelle, was astonished, and said, By Allah, O my brother, thy faithfulness
is great, and thy story is wonderful! if it were engraved upon
the intellect, it would be a lesson to him who would be admonished!&mdash;And
he sat down by his side, and said, By Allah, O my brother, I
will not quit this place until I see what will happen unto thee with
this 'Efreet. So he sat down, and conversed with him. And the
merchant became almost senseless; fear entered him, and terror, and
violent grief, and excessive anxiety. And as the owner of the gazelle
sat by his side, lo, a second sheykh approached them, with two black
hounds, and inquired of them, after saluting them, the reason of their
sitting in that place, seeing that it was a resort of the J&aacute;nn:<a href="#I10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and
they told him the story from beginning to end. And he had hardly
sat down when there approached them a third sheykh, with a dapple
mule; and he asked them the same question, which was answered in
the same manner.</p>

<p>Immediately after, the dust was agitated, and became an enormous
revolving pillar, approaching them from the midst of the desert; and
this dust subsided, and behold, the Jinnee, with a drawn sword in his
hand; his eyes casting forth sparks of fire. He came to them, and
dragged from them the merchant, and said to him, Rise, that I may
kill thee, as thou killedst my son, the vital spirit of my heart. And
the merchant wailed and wept; and the three sheykhs also manifested
their sorrow by weeping and crying aloud and wailing: but the first
sheykh, who was the owner of the gazelle, recovering his self-possession,
kissed the hand of the 'Efreet, and said to him, O thou Jinnee,
and crown of the kings of the J&aacute;nn, if I relate to thee the story of
myself and this gazelle, and thou find it to be wonderful, and more so
than the adventure of this merchant, wilt thou give up to me a third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
of thy claim to his blood? He answered, Yes, O sheykh; if thou
relate to me the story, and I find it to be as thou hast said, I will
give up to thee a third of my claim to his blood.</p>

<hr />
<h5>THE STORY OF THE FIRST SHEYKH AND THE GAZELLE.</h5>

<p>Then said the sheykh, Know, O 'Efreet, that this gazelle is the
daughter of my paternal uncle,<a href="#I11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and she is of my flesh and my blood.
I took her as my wife when she was young,<a href="#I12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and lived with her about
thirty years; but I was not blessed with a child by her; so I took to
me a concubine slave,<a href="#I13" class="fnanchor">13</a> and by her I was blessed with a male child,
like the rising full moon, with beautiful eyes, and delicately-shaped
eyebrows, and perfectly-formed limbs; and he grew up by little and
little until he attained the age of fifteen years. At this period, I
unexpectedly had occasion to journey to a certain city, and went
thither with a great stock of merchandise.</p>

<p>Now my cousin,<a href="#I14" class="fnanchor">14</a> this gazelle, had studied enchantment and
divination from her early years; and during my absence, she transformed
the youth above mentioned into a calf; and his mother, into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
a cow;<a href="#I15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and committed them to the care of the herdsman: and when
I returned, after a long time, from my journey, I asked after my son
and his mother, and she said, Thy slave is dead, and thy son hath fled,
and I know not whither he is gone. After hearing this, I remained
for the space of a year with mourning heart and weeping eye, until
the Festival of the Sacrifice;<a href="#I16" class="fnanchor">16</a> when I sent to the herdsman, and
ordered him to choose for me a fat cow; and he brought me one, and
it was my concubine, whom this gazelle had enchanted. I tucked up
my skirts and sleeves, and took the knife<a href="#I17" class="fnanchor">17</a> in my hand, and prepared
myself to slaughter her; upon which she moaned and cried so violently
that I left her, and ordered the herdsman to kill and skin her: and
he did so, but found in her neither fat nor flesh, nor anything but
skin and bone; and I repented of slaughtering her, when repentance
was of no avail. I therefore gave her to the herdsman, and said to
him, Bring me a fat calf: and he brought me my son, who was
transformed into a calf. And when the calf saw me, he broke his
rope, and came to me, and fawned upon me, and wailed and cried, so
that I was moved with pity for him; and I said to the herdsman,
Bring me a cow, and let this&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; position: relative;"><a name="f25" id="f25"></a><img src="images/fig25.png" width="400" height="280" alt="Transformation of the Concubine into a Cow" title="Transformation of the Concubine into a Cow" /></div>

<p>Here Shahraz&aacute;d perceived the light of morning, and discontinued
the recitation with which she had been allowed thus far to
proceed. Her sister said to her, How excellent is thy story! and
how pretty! and how pleasant! and how sweet!&mdash;but she answered,
What is this in comparison with that which I will relate to thee in
the next night, if I live, and the King spare me! And the King
said, By Allah, I will not kill her until I hear the remainder of her
story. Thus they pleasantly passed the night until the morning,
when the King went forth to his hall of judgment, and the Wezeer
went thither with the grave-clothes under his arm: and the King<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
gave judgment, and invested and displaced, until the close of the
day, without informing the Wezeer of that which had happened; and
the minister was greatly astonished. The court was then dissolved;
and the King returned to the privacy of his palace.</p>

<p>[On the second and each succeeding night, Shahraz&aacute;d continued
so to interest King Shahriy&aacute;r by her stories as to induce him to defer
putting her to death, in expectation that her fund of amusing tales
would soon be exhausted; and as this is expressed in the original
work in nearly the same words at the close of every night, such
repetitions will in the present translation be omitted.<a href="#I18" class="fnanchor">18</a>]</p>

<p>When the sheykh, continued Shahraz&aacute;d, observed the tears of the
calf, his heart sympathized with him, and he said to the herdsman,
Let this calf remain with the cattle.&mdash;Meanwhile, the Jinnee wondered
at this strange story; and the owner of the gazelle thus proceeded.</p>

<p>O lord of the kings of the J&aacute;nn, while this happened, my cousin,
this gazelle, looked on, and said, Slaughter this calf; for he is fat:
but I could not do it; so I ordered the herdsman to take him back;
and he took him and went away. And as I was sitting, on the following
day, he came to me, and said, O my master, I have to tell thee
something that thou wilt be rejoiced to hear; and a reward is due
to me for bringing good news.<a href="#I19" class="fnanchor">19</a> I answered, Well:&mdash;and he said,
O merchant, I have a daughter who learned enchantment in her youth
from an old woman in our family; and yesterday, when thou gavest
me the calf, I took him to her, and she looked at him, and covered
her face, and wept, and then laughed, and said, O my father, hath
my condition become so degraded in thy opinion that thou bringest
before me strange men?<a href="#I20" class="fnanchor">20</a>&mdash;Where, said I, are any strange men? and
wherefore didst thou weep and laugh? She answered, This calf that
is with thee is the son of our master, the merchant, and the wife of
our master hath enchanted both him and his mother; and this was
the reason of my laughter; but as to the reason of my weeping, it
was on account of his mother, because his father had slaughtered her.&mdash;And
I was excessively astonished at this; and scarcely was I certain
that the light of morning had appeared when I hastened to inform thee.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px; position: relative;"><a name="f26" id="f26"></a><img src="images/fig26.png" width="450" height="554" alt="The Herdsman introducing his Daughter to the Sheykh" title="The Herdsman introducing his Daughter to the Sheykh" /></div>

<p>When I heard, O Jinnee, the words of the herdsman, I went forth
with him, intoxicated without wine, from the excessive joy and happiness
that I received, and arrived at his house, where his daughter
welcomed me, and kissed my hand; and the calf came to me, and
fawned upon me. And I said to the herdsman's daughter, Is that true
which thou hast said respecting this calf? She answered, Yes, O my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
master; he is verily thy son, and the vital spirit of thy heart.&mdash;O
maiden, said I, if thou wilt restore him, all the cattle and other
property of mine that thy father hath under his care shall be thine.
Upon this, she smiled, and said, O my master, I have no desire for the
property unless on two conditions: the first is, that thou shalt marry
me to him; and the second, that I shall enchant her who enchanted
him, and so restrain her; otherwise, I shall not be secure from her
artifice. On hearing, O Jinnee, these her words, I said, And thou
shalt have all the property that is under the care of thy father besides;
and as to my cousin, even her blood shall be lawful to thee. So, when
she heard this, she took a cup, and filled it with water, and repeated
a spell over it, and sprinkled with it the calf, saying to him, If God
created thee a calf, remain in this form, and be not changed; but if
thou be enchanted, return to thy original form, by permission of God,
whose name be exalted!&mdash;upon which he shook, and became a man;
and I threw myself upon him, and said, I conjure thee by Allah that
thou relate to me all that my cousin did to thee and to thy mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
So he related to me all that had happened to them both; and I said to
him, O my son, God hath given thee one to liberate thee, and to avenge
thee:&mdash;and I married to him, O Jinnee, the herdsman's daughter; after
which, she transformed my cousin into this gazelle. And as I happened
to pass this way, I saw this merchant, and asked him what had
happened to him; and when he had informed me, I sat down to see
the result.&mdash;This is my story. The Jinnee said, This is a wonderful
tale; and I give up to thee a third of my claim to his blood.</p>

<p>The second sheykh, the owner of the two hounds, then advanced,
and said to the Jinnee, If I relate to thee the story of myself and these
hounds, and thou find it to be in like manner wonderful, wilt thou
remit to me, also, a third of thy claim to the blood of this merchant?
The Jinnee answered, Yes.</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE SECOND SHEYKH AND THE TWO BLACK HOUNDS.</h5>

<p>Then said the sheykh, Know, O lord of the kings of the J&aacute;nn,
that these two hounds are my brothers. My father died, and left to
us three thousand pieces of gold;<a href="#I21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and I opened a shop<a href="#I22" class="fnanchor">22</a> to sell and
buy. But one of my brothers made a journey, with a stock of merchandise,
and was absent from us for the space of a year with the
caravans; after which, he returned destitute. I said to him, Did I not
advise thee to abstain from travelling? But he wept, and said, O my
brother, God, to whom be ascribed all might and glory, decreed this
event; and there is no longer any profit in these words: I have
nothing left. So I took him up into the shop, and then went with
him to the bath, and clad him in a costly suit of my own clothing;
after which, we sat down together to eat; and I said to him, O my
brother, I will calculate the gain of my shop during the year, and
divide it, exclusive of the principal, between me and thee. Accordingly,
I made the calculation, and found my gain to amount to two
thousand pieces of gold; and I praised God, to whom be ascribed all
might and glory, and rejoiced exceedingly, and divided the gain in two
equal parts between myself and him.&mdash;My other brother then set forth
on a journey; and after a year, returned in the like condition; and
I did unto him as I had done to the former.</p>

<p>After this, when we had lived together for some time, my brothers
again wished to travel, and were desirous that I should accompany<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
them; but I would not. What, said I, have ye gained in your travels,
that I should expect to gain? They importuned me; but I would not
comply with their request; and we remained selling and buying in
our shops a whole year. Still, however, they persevered in proposing
that we should travel, and I still refused, until after the lapse of six
entire years, when at last I consented, and said to them, O my
brothers, let us calculate what property we possess. We did so, and
found it to be six thousand pieces of gold: and I then said to them,
We will bury half of it in the earth, that it may be of service to us if
any misfortune befall us, in which case each of us shall take a thousand
pieces, with which to traffic.<a href="#I23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Excellent is thy advice, said they. So
I took the money and divided it into two equal portions, and buried
three thousand pieces of gold; and of the other half, I gave to each
of them a thousand pieces. We then prepared merchandise, and hired
a ship, and embarked our goods, and proceeded on our voyage for the
space of a whole month, at the expiration of which we arrived at a
city, where we sold our merchandise; and for every piece of gold we
gained ten.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px; position: relative;"><a name="f28" id="f28"></a><img src="images/fig28.png" width="450" height="189" alt="The Second Sheykh finding the Maiden on the Sea-shore" title="The Second Sheykh finding the Maiden on the Sea-shore" /></div>

<p>And when we were about to set sail again, we found, on the shore
of the sea, a maiden clad in tattered garments, who kissed my hand,
and said to me, O my master, art thou possessed of charity and kindness?
If so, I will requite thee for them. I answered, Yes, I have
those qualities, though thou requite me not. Then said she, O my
master, accept me as thy wife, and take me to thy country; for I
give myself to thee:<a href="#I24" class="fnanchor">24</a> act kindly towards me; for I am one who requires
to be treated with kindness and charity, and who will requite
thee for so doing; and let not my present condition at all deceive
thee. When I heard these words, my heart was moved with tenderness
towards her, in order to the accomplishment of a purpose of God,
to whom be ascribed all might and glory; and I took her, and clothed
her, and furnished for her a place in the ship in a handsome manner,
and regarded her with kind and respectful attention.</p>

<p>We then set sail; and I became most cordially attached to my
wife, so that, on her account, I neglected the society of my brothers,
who, in consequence, became jealous of me, and likewise envied me my
wealth, and the abundance of my merchandise; casting the eyes of
covetousness upon the whole of the property. They therefore consulted
together to kill me, and take my wealth; saying, Let us kill
our brother, and all the property shall be ours:&mdash;and the devil made
these actions to seem fair in their eyes; so they came to me while
I was sleeping by the side of my wife, and took both of us up, and
threw us into the sea. But as soon as my wife awoke, she shook
herself, and became transformed into a Jinneeyeh.<a href="#I25" class="fnanchor">25</a>  She immediately
bore me away, and placed me upon an island, and, for a while, disappeared.
In the morning, however, she returned, and said to me,
I am thy wife, who carried thee, and rescued thee from death, by
permission of God, whose name be exalted. Know that I am a
Jinneeyeh: I saw thee, and my heart loved thee for the sake of God;
for I am a believer in God and his Apostle, God bless and save him!<a href="#I26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
I came to thee in the condition in which thou sawest me, and thou
didst marry me; and see, I have rescued thee from drowning. But
I am incensed against thy brothers, and I must kill them.&mdash;When I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
heard her tale, I was astonished, and thanked her for what she had
done;&mdash;But, said I, as to the destruction of my brothers, it is not what
I desire. I then related to her all that had happened between myself
and them from first to last; and when she had heard it, she said, I
will, this next night, fly to them, and sink their ship, and destroy them.
But I said, I conjure thee by Allah that thou do it not; for the
author of the proverb saith, O thou benefactor of him who hath done
evil, the action that he hath done is sufficient for him:<a href="#I27" class="fnanchor">27</a>&mdash;besides,
they are at all events my brothers. She still, however, said, They
must be killed;&mdash;and I continued to propitiate her towards them: and
at last she lifted me up, and soared through the air, and placed me on
the roof of my house.<a href="#I28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f29" id="f29"></a><img src="images/fig29.png" width="550" height="580" alt="The Second Sheykh saved from drowning" title="The Second Sheykh saved from drowning" /></div>

<p>Having opened the doors, I dug up what I had hidden in the
earth; and after I had saluted my neighbours, and bought merchandise,
I opened my shop. And in the following night, when I entered
my house, I found these two dogs tied up in it; and as soon as they
saw me, they came to me, and wept, and clung to me; but I knew
not what had happened until immediately my wife appeared before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
me, and said, These are thy brothers. And who, said I, hath done
this unto them? She answered, I sent to my sister and she did it;
and they shall not be restored until after the lapse of ten years. And
I was now on my way to her, that she might restore them, as they
have been in this state ten years, when I saw this man, and, being
informed of what had befallen him, I determined not to quit the place
until I should have seen what would happen between thee and him.&mdash;This
is my story.&mdash;Verily, said the Jinnee, it is a wonderful tale; and
I give up to thee a third of the claim that I had to his blood on
account of his offence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px; position: relative;"><a name="f30" id="f30"></a><img src="images/fig30.png" width="350" height="280" alt="The Second Sheykh and the two Black Hounds" title="The Second Sheykh and the two Black Hounds" /></div>

<p>Upon this, the third sheykh, the owner of the mule, said to the
Jinnee,<a href="#I29" class="fnanchor">29</a> As to me, break not my heart if I relate to thee nothing
more than this:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE THIRD SHEYKH AND THE MULE.</h5>

<p>The mule that thou seest was my wife: she became enamoured
of a black slave; and when I discovered her with him, she took a mug
of water, and, having uttered a spell over it, sprinkled me, and transformed
me into a dog. In this state, I ran to the shop of a butcher,
whose daughter saw me, and, being skilled in enchantment, restored
me to my original form, and instructed me to enchant my wife in the
manner thou beholdest.&mdash;And now I hope that thou wilt remit to me
also a third of the merchant's offence. Divinely was he gifted who
said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sow good, even on an unworthy soil; for it will not be lost wherever it is sown.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the sheykh had thus finished his story, the Jinnee shook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
with delight, and remitted the remaining third of his claim to the
merchant's blood. The merchant then approached the sheykhs, and
thanked them, and they congratulated him on his safety; and each
went his way.</p>

<p>But this, said Shahraz&aacute;d, is not more wonderful than the story of
the fisherman. The King asked her, And what is the story of the
fisherman? And she related it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h5>NOTES TO CHAPTER FIRST.</h5>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I1" id="I1">1.</a></span> The words "in a garden" are omitted in my original; but they are
required by the sequel. I may here remark, that, in future, when I find trifling
insertions of this kind to be requisite in my translation, I shall not deem it necessary
to mention them in a note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I2" id="I2">2.</a></span> An Eastern traveller often makes a long journey with no other encumbrance
than a well-filled pair of saddle-bags: in one bag he puts his provisions; and in
the other, such articles of clothing as he may require in addition to those in which
he sets out, including a spare shirt, and perhaps no other clean linen: for he is as
indifferent with regard to this comfort as he is careful respecting his <i>personal</i>
cleanliness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I3" id="I3">3.</a></span> Perhaps no reader of this work will require to be told that the date has
not a <i>shell</i>. I only make this remark on account of an error in the old translation.&mdash;As
dates are very nutritious, and are preserved by being merely dried in the sun, they are
an excellent article of provision for travellers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I4" id="I4">4.</a></span> The merchant was culpably careless: before throwing aside the date-stone
with sufficient force to kill a Jinnee who happened to be near him (though at the
time invisible), he should have asked permission by the exclamation "Destoor!" as
explained in a note appended to the Introduction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I5" id="I5">5.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Fate and Destiny.</i> The belief in fate and destiny ("el-&#7731;a&#7693;&agrave; wa-l-&#7731;adar")
exercises a most powerful influence upon the actions and character of the
Muslims; and it is therefore highly important that the reader of the present work
should be acquainted with the notions which these people entertain respecting such
matters of faith. I use two words (perhaps the best that our language affords) to
express corresponding Arabic terms, which some persons regard as synonymous, but
others distinguish by different shades of meaning. On what I consider the best
authority, the word which I render "fate" respects the decrees of God in a general
sense; while that which I translate "destiny" relates to the particular applications
of those decrees. In such senses these terms are here to be understood when separately
employed.</p>

<p>Many Muslims hold that fate is, in some respects, absolute and unchangeable; in
others, admitting of alteration; and almost all of them <i>act</i>, in many of the affairs of
life, as if this were their belief. In the former case, it is called "el-&#7731;a&#7693;&agrave; el-Mo&#7717;kam:"
in the latter, "el-&#7731;a&#7693;&agrave; el-Mubram" (which term, without the explanation here given,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
might be regarded as exactly synonymous with the former). Hence, the Prophet, it
is said, prayed to be preserved from the latter, as knowing that it might be changed;
and in allusion to this changeable fate, God, we are told, says, "God will cancel what
He pleaseth, and confirm;"<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> while, on the contrary, the fate which is termed "Mo&#7717;kam"
is appointed "destiny" decreed by God.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>Many doctors have argued, that destiny respects only the <i>final state</i> of a certain
portion of men (believers and unbelievers); and that, in general, man is endowed with
free will, which he should exercise according to the laws of God and his own conscience
and judgment, praying to God for a blessing on his endeavours, or imploring the
intercession of the Prophet, or of any of the saints, in his favour, and propitiating them
by offering alms or sacrifices in their names; relying upon God for the result, which he
may then, and then only, attribute to fate or destiny. They hold, therefore, that it is
criminal to attempt resistance to the will when its dictates are conformable with
the laws of God and our natural consciences and prudence, and so passively to await
the fulfilment of God's decrees.&mdash;The doctrine of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n and the Traditions
respecting the decrees of God, or fate and destiny, appears, however, to be, that
they are altogether absolute and unchangeable,&mdash;written, in the beginning of the
creation, on the "Preserved Tablet," in heaven; that God hath predestined every event
and action, evil as well as good; at the same time commanding and approving good,
and forbidding and hating evil; and that the "cancelling" mentioned in the preceding
paragraph relates (as the context seems to shew) to the abrogation of former scriptures,
or revelations; not of fate. But still it must be held that He hath not predestined the
<i>will</i>; though He sometimes inclines it to good, and the Devil sometimes inclines it to
evil. It is asked, then, If we have the power to will, but not the power to perform
otherwise than as God hath predetermined, how can we be regarded as responsible
beings? The answer to this is, that our actions are judged good or evil according to
our intentions, if we have faith: good actions or intentions, it should be added, only
increase, and do not cause, our happiness, if we are believers; and evil actions or
intentions only increase our misery if we are unbelievers or irreligious: for the Muslim
holds that he is to be admitted into heaven only by the mercy of God, on account of
his faith; and to be rewarded in proportion to his good works.</p>

<p>The Prophet's assertions on the subject of God's decrees are considered of the highest
importance as explanatory of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n.&mdash;"Whatever is in the universe," said he,
"is by the order of God."&mdash;"God hath pre-ordained five things on his servants; the
duration of life, their actions, their dwelling-places, their travels, and their portions."&mdash;"There
is not one among you whose sitting-place is not written by God, whether
in the fire or in paradise."<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>&mdash;Some of the Companions of the Prophet, on hearing
the last-quoted saying, asked him, "O Prophet, since God hath appointed our places,
may we confide in this, and abandon our religious and moral duties?" He answered,
"No: because the happy will do good works, and those who are of the miserable will
do bad works."&mdash;The following of his sayings further illustrate this subject.&mdash;"When
God hath ordered a creature to die in any particular place, He causeth his wants to
direct him to that place."&mdash;A Companion asked, "O Prophet of God, inform me respecting
charms, and the medicines which I swallow, and shields which I make use of for
protection, whether they prevent any of the orders of God."  Mo&#7717;ammad answered,
"These also are by the order of God."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> "There is a medicine for every pain: then,
when the medicine reaches the pain, it is cured by the order of God."<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>&mdash;When a
Muslim, therefore, feels an inclination to make use of medicine for the cure of a disease,
he should do so, in the hope of its being predestined that he shall be so cured.</p>

<p>On the predestination of diseases, I find the following curious quotation and remark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>in a manuscript work, by Es-Suyoo&#7789;ee, in my possession.&mdash;"El-&#7716;aleemee says, 'Communicable
or contagious diseases are six: small-pox, measles, itch or scab, foul breath or
putridity, melancholy, and pestilential maladies; and diseases engendered are also six:
leprosy, hectic, epilepsy, gout, elephantiasis, and phthisis.' But this does not contradict
the saying of the Prophet, 'There is no transition of diseases by contagion or infection,
nor any omen that brings evil:' for the transition here meant is one occasioned by
the disease itself; whereas the effect is of God, who causes pestilence to spread when
there is intercourse with the diseased."<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>&mdash;A Bedawee asked the Prophet, "What is
the condition of camels which stay in the deserts? verily, you might say, they are deer,
in health and in cleanness of skin; then they mix with mangy camels, and they become
mangy also." Mo&#7717;ammad said, "What made the first camel mangy?"<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, the arguments which have been here adduced, and many
others that might be added, declaring or implying the unchangeable nature of all
God's decrees, I have found it to be the opinion of my own Muslim friends, that God
may be induced, by supplication, to change certain of his decrees; at least, those
regarding degrees of happiness or misery in this world and the next; and that such
is the general opinion, appears from a form of prayer which is repeated in the mosques
on the eve of the middle (or fifteenth day) of the month of Sha&#7841;b&aacute;n; when it is
believed that such portions of God's decrees as constitute the destinies of all living
creatures for the ensuing year, are confirmed and fixed. In this prayer it is said, "O
God, if Thou <i>hast recorded</i> me in thine abode, upon 'the Original of the Book' [the
Preserved Tablet], miserable, or unfortunate, or scanted in my sustenance, <i>cancel</i>, O
God, of thy goodness, my misery, and misfortune, and scanty allowance of sustenance,
and confirm me, in thine abode, upon the Original of the Book, as happy, and provided
for, and directed to good," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>The Arabs in general constantly have recourse both to charms and medicines, not
only for the cure, but also for the prevention of diseases. They have, indeed, a strange
passion for medicine, which shows that they do not consider fate as altogether unconditional.
Nothing can exceed the earnestness with which they often press a European
traveller for a dose; and the more violent the remedy, the better are they pleased.
The following case will serve as an example:&mdash;Three donkey-drivers, conveying the
luggage of two British travellers from Bool&aacute;&#7731; to Cairo, opened a bottle which they
observed in a basket, and finding it to contain, as they had suspected, brandy, emptied it
down their throats: but he who had the last, on turning up the bottle, got the tail of a
scorpion into his mouth; and, looking through the bottle, to his great horror, saw that
it contained a number of these reptiles, with tarantulas, vipers, and beetles. Thinking
that they had poisoned themselves, but not liking to rely upon fate, they persuaded a
man to come to me for medicine. He introduced the subject by saying, "O Efendee,
do an act of kindness: there are three men poisoned; in your mercy give them medicine,
and save their lives:" and then he related the whole affair, without concealing the
theft. I replied, that they did not deserve medicine; but he urged that, by giving it, I
should obtain an immense reward. "Yes," said I; "'he who saveth a soul alive shall
be as if he had saved the lives of all mankind.'"<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> I said this to try the feeling of the
applicant, who, expressing admiration of my knowledge, urged me to be quick, lest the
men should die; thus showing himself to be no unconditional fatalist. I gave him
three strong doses of tartar emetic; and he soon came back to thank me, saying that
the medicine was most admirable, for the men had hardly swallowed it, when they
almost vomited their hearts and livers, and everything else in their bodies.</p>

<p>From a distrust in faith, some Muslims even shut themselves up during the prevalence
of plague; but this practice is generally condemned. A Syrian friend of mine, who did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>so, nearly had his door broken open by his neighbours. Another of my friends, one of
the most distinguished of the 'Ulam&agrave;, confessed to me his conviction of the lawfulness
of quarantine, and argued well in favour of it; but said that he dared not openly avow
such an opinion. "The Apostle of God," said he, "God bless and save him! hath
commanded that we should not enter a city where there is pestilence, nor go out from
it. Why did he say, 'Enter it not?'&mdash;because, by so doing, we should expose ourselves
to the disease. Why did he say, 'Go not out from it?'&mdash;because, by so doing, we
should carry the disease to others. The Prophet was tenderly considerate of our
welfare: but the present Muslims in general are like bulls [brute beasts]; and they
hold the meaning of this command to be, Go not into a city where there is pestilence,
because this would be rashness; and go not out from it, because this would be distrusting
God's power to save you from it."</p>

<p>Many of the vulgar and ignorant among modern Muslims, believe that the unchangeable
destinies of every man are written upon his head, in what are termed the sutures
of the skull.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I6" id="I6">6.</a></span> The paragraph thus commencing, and the verses comprised in it, are
translated from the Calcutta edition of the first two hundred nights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I7" id="I7">7.</a></span> It is a common custom for a Muslim, on a military expedition, or during
a long journey, especially in the desert, to carry his grave-linen with him; for he is
extremely careful that he may be buried according to the law.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> It seems to be implied
in our tale, that the merchant hoped that the Jinnee, or some passing traveller, would
wash, shroud, and bury him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I8" id="I8">8.</a></span> It is thus that the Arab women generally do on the occasion of a funeral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I9" id="I9">9.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the title of</i> Sheykh. "Sheykh" is an appellation which literally
signifies "an elder," or "an aged person," and in this sense it is here used; but it is
also commonly employed as synonymous with our appellation of "Mister;" and particularly
applied to a learned man, or a reputed saint. In every case, it is a title of
respect, and never given to any but a Muslim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I10" id="I10">10.</a></span> "J&aacute;nn" is here used as synonymous with "Jinn."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I11" id="I11">11.</a></span> A cousin (the daughter of a paternal uncle) is often chosen as a wife, on
account of the tie of blood, which is likely to attach her more strongly to her husband;
or on account of an affection conceived in early years. The various customs relating
to marriage, I shall describe on a future occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I12" id="I12">12.</a></span> A bride is called young, by the Arabs, when she is about twelve years
of age. In the Calcutta edition of the first two hundred nights, the wife in this tale
is said to have been of this age when she was first married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I13" id="I13">13.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Slaves.</i> A slave, among Muslims, is either a person taken captive
in war, or carried off by force, and being at the time of capture an infidel; or the
offspring of a female slave by another slave, or by any man who is not her owner, or by
her owner, if he does not acknowledge himself to be the father: but the offspring of a
male slave by a free woman is free. A person who embraces the Mohammadan faith
after having been made a slave, does not by this act become free, unless he flees from
a foreign infidel master to a Muslim country, and there becomes a Mohammadan. A
person cannot have as a slave one whom he acknowledges to be within the prohibited
degrees of marriage.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>&mdash;The slaves of the Arabs are mostly from Abyssinia and the
Negro countries: a few, mostly in the houses of wealthy individuals, are from Georgia
and Circassia.</p>

<p>Slaves have no civil liberty; but are entirely under the authority of their owners,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>whatever may be the religion, sex, or age, of the latter; and can possess no property,
unless by the owner's permission. The owner is entire master, while he pleases, of the
person and goods of his slave; and of the offspring of his female slave, which, if
begotten by him or presumed to be so, he may recognise as his own legitimate child, or
not: the child, if recognised by him, enjoys the same privileges as the offspring of a
free wife; and if not recognised by him, is his slave. The master may even kill his own
slave with impunity for any offence; and he incurs but a slight punishment (as imprisonment
for a period at the discretion of the judge) if he kills him wantonly. He
may give away or sell his slaves, excepting in some cases which will be mentioned; and
may marry them to whom he will, but not separate them when married. A slave,
however, according to most of the doctors, cannot have more than two wives at the
same time. Unemancipated slaves, at the death of their master, become the property
of his heirs; and when an emancipated slave dies, leaving no male descendants or
collateral relations, the former master is the heir; or, if he be dead, his heirs inherit
the slave's property. As a slave enjoys less advantages than a free person, the law,
in some cases, ordains that his punishment for an offence shall be half of that to which
the free is liable to the same offence, or even less than half: if it be a fine, or pecuniary
compensation, it must be paid by the owner, to the amount, if necessary, of the value of
the slave, or the slave must be given in compensation.</p>

<p>The owner, but not the part-owner, may cohabit with any of his female slaves who
is a Mohammadan, a Christian, or a Jewess, if he has not married her to another man;
but not with two or more who are sisters, or who are related to each other in any of
the degrees which would prevent their both being his wives at the same time if they
were free: after having so lived with one, he must entirely relinquish such intercourse
with her before he can do the same with another who is so related to her. He cannot
have this intercourse with a pagan slave. A Christian or Jew may have slaves, but not
enjoy the privilege above mentioned with one who is a Mohammadan. The master
must wait a certain period (generally from a month to three months) after the acquisition
of a female slave, before he can have such intercourse with her. If he find any
fault in her within three days, he is usually allowed to return her.</p>

<p>When a man, from being the husband, becomes the master, of a slave, the marriage
is dissolved, and he cannot continue to live with her but as her master, enjoying, however,
all a master's privileges; unless he emancipates her; in which case he may again
take her as his wife with her consent. In like manner, when a woman, from being the
wife, becomes the possessor, of a slave, the marriage is dissolved, and cannot be renewed
unless she emancipates him, and he consents to the re-union.</p>

<p>Complete and immediate emancipation is sometimes granted to a slave gratuitously,
or for a future pecuniary compensation. It is conferred by means of a written document,
or by a verbal declaration (expressed in the words, "Thou art free," or some
similar phrase) in the presence of two witnesses, or by returning the certificate of sale
obtained from the former owner. Future emancipation is sometimes covenanted to be
granted on the fulfilment of certain conditions; and more frequently, to be conferred on
the occasion of the owner's death. In the latter case, the owner cannot sell the slave
to whom he has made this promise: and, as he cannot alienate by will more than one-third
of the whole property that he leaves, the law ordains that, if the value of the said
slave exceeds that portion, the slave must obtain and pay the additional sum. When
a female slave has borne a child to her master, and he acknowledges the child to be
his own, he cannot sell this slave, and she becomes free on his death.</p>

<p>Abyssinian and white female slaves are kept by many men of the middle and higher
classes, and often instead of wives, as requiring less expense, and being more subservient;
but they are generally indulged with the same luxuries as free ladies; their
vanity is gratified by costly dresses and ornaments, and they rank high above free servants;
as do also the male slaves. Those called Abyssinians appear to be a mixed race
between negroes and whites; and are from the territories of the Gallas. They are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
mostly kidnapped and sold by their own countrymen. The negro female slaves, as few
of them have considerable personal attractions (which is not the case with the Abyssinians,
many of whom are very beautiful), are usually employed only in cooking, and
other menial offices. The female slaves of the higher classes are often instructed in plain
needlework and embroidery, and sometimes in music and dancing. Formerly, many of
them possessed sufficient literary accomplishments to quote largely from esteemed
poems, or even to compose extemporary verses, which they would often accompany with
the lute. The condition of many concubine slaves is happy; and that of many, quite
the contrary. These, and all other slaves of either sex, are generally treated with
kindness; but at first they are usually importuned, and not unfrequently used with
much harshness, to induce them to embrace the Mohammadan faith; which almost all
of them do. Their services are commonly light: the usual office of the male white
slave, who is called "memlook," is that of a page, or a military guard. Eunuchs are
employed as guardians of the women; but only in the houses of men of high rank, or of
great wealth: on account of the important and confidential office which they fill, they
are generally treated in public with especial consideration. I used to remark, in Cairo,
that few persons saluted me with a more dignified and consequential air than these
pitiable but self-conceited beings. Most of them are Abyssinians or Negroes. Indeed,
the slaves in general take too much advantage of the countenance of their masters,
especially when they belong to men in power. The master is bound to afford his slaves
proper food and clothing, or to let them work for their own support, or to sell, give
away, or liberate them. It is, however, considered disgraceful for him to sell a slave
who has been long in his possession; and it seldom happens that a master emancipates
a female slave, without marrying her to some man able to support her, or otherwise providing
for her.</p>

<p>The Prophet strongly enjoined the duty of kindness to slaves. "Feed your memlooks,"
said he, "with food of that which ye eat, and clothe them with such clothing as
ye wear; and command them not to do that which they are unable."<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>&mdash;These precepts
are generally attended to, either entirely or in a great degree. Some other sayings of
the Prophet on this subject well deserve to be mentioned; as the following:&mdash;"He who
beats his slave without fault, or slaps him on the face, his atonement for this is freeing
him."&mdash;"A man who behaves ill to his slave will not enter into paradise."&mdash;"Whoever
is the cause of separation between mother and child, by selling or giving, God will separate
him from his friends on the day of resurrection."&mdash;"When a slave wishes well to
his master, and worships God well, for him are double rewards."<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>&mdash;It is related of
'Othm&aacute;n, "that he twisted the ear of a memlook belonging to him, on account of disobedience,
and afterwards, repenting of it, ordered him to twist <i>his</i> ear in like manner:
but he would not. 'Othm&aacute;n urged him, and the memlook advanced, and began to
wring it by little and little. He said to him, 'Wring it hard; for I cannot endure the
punishment of the day of judgment [on account of this act].' The memlook answered,
'O my master, the day that thou fearest, I also fear.'"&mdash;"It is related also of Zeyn-el-'&Aacute;bideen,
that he had a memlook who seized a sheep, and broke its leg; and he said to
him, 'Why didst thou this?' He answered, 'To provoke thee to anger.' 'And I,' said
he, 'will provoke to anger him who taught thee; and he is Iblees: go, and be free, for
the sake of God.'"<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>&mdash;Many similar anecdotes might be added; but the general assertions
of travellers in the East are more satisfactory evidence in favour of the humane conduct
of most Muslims to their slaves.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, though rarely, that free girls are sold as slaves.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> A remarkable
instance is related in the "Mir-&aacute;t ez-Zem&aacute;n."<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>&mdash;F&aacute;&#7789;imeh, surnamed Ghareeb, a
slave of the Khaleefeh El-Mo&#7841;ta&#7779;im, the son of H&aacute;roon, was a poetess, accomplished
in singing and calligraphy, and extremely beautiful. Her mother was an orphan; and</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p><p>Ja&#7841;far, the famous Wezeer of H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed, took her as his wife; but his father,
Ya&#7717;y&agrave;, reproached him for marrying a woman whose father and mother were unknown,
and he therefore removed her from his own residence to a neighbouring house, where
he frequently visited her; and she bore him a daughter, the above-mentioned Ghareeb,
and died. Ja&#7841;far committed her infant to the care of a Christian woman, to nurse; and,
on the overthrow of his family, this woman sold her young charge as a slave. El-Emeen,
the successor of Er-Rasheed, bought her of a man named Sumbul, but never
paid her price; and when he was killed, she returned to her former master; but on the
arrival of El-Ma-moon at Baghd&aacute;d, she was described to him, and he compelled Sumbul
to sell her to him. This Sumbul loved her so passionately, that he died of grief at her
loss. On the death of El-Ma-moon, his successor, El-Mo&#7841;ta&#7779;im, bought her for a hundred
thousand dirhems, and emancipated her. The historian adds, that she composed several
well-known airs and verses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I14" id="I14">14.</a></span> An Arab who is married to his cousin generally calls her by this appellation
rather than that of wife, as the tie of blood is, to him, in every respect, stronger
than that of matrimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I15" id="I15">15.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Magic.</i> The Arabs and other Mohammadans enjoy a remarkable
advantage over <i>us</i> in the composition of works of fiction: in the invention of incidents
which <i>we</i> should regard as absurd in the extreme, <i>they</i> cannot be accused by their
countrymen of exceeding the bounds of probability. A case similar to that here
described was related to me as a fact, in Cairo. A person in that city, I was told, was
suddenly surprised by the disappearance of his brother, and by finding, in his place, an
ass: but this animal increased his astonishment, and that of every person who beheld
him, by manifesting a sagacity singularly opposed to the proverbial dulness of the
generality of his species. Yet, strange as it may seem, it was not imagined that this
brute was the lost man in a transformed state, till, one day, an old woman, seeing him,
quickly covered her face, and declared the fact. She discovered this by her knowledge
of magic; and, by her skill in this art, she agreed to restore the enchanted person to
his proper shape. Having collected a number of herbs, she boiled them in a large
vessel; and when the decoction had cooled, she took the vessel, and, muttering a
certain spell, threw its contents over the animal, endeavouring to do so in such a
manner that every part of it should be wetted. Every part of it <i>was</i> wetted, excepting
one hind-foot; and, accordingly, it was restored to the original human form, with the
exception of one foot, which remained like that of an ass.</p>

<p>An implicit belief in magic is entertained by almost all Muslims; and he, among
them, who denies its truth, they regard as a freethinker, or an infidel. Some are of
opinion that it ceased on the mission of Mo&#7717;ammad; but these are comparatively
few. Many of the most learned Muslims, to the present age, have deeply studied
it; and a much greater number of persons of inferior education (particularly school-masters)
have, more or less, devoted their time and talents to the pursuit of this
knowledge. Recourse is had to it for the discovery of hidden treasures, for alchymical
purposes, for the acquisition of the knowledge of futurity, to procure offspring, to
obtain the affection of a beloved object, to effect cures, to guard against the influence
of the evil eye, to afflict or kill an enemy or a rival, and to attain various other objects
of desire.</p>

<p>There are two descriptions of magic; one is spiritual, and regarded by all but freethinkers
as true; the other, natural, and denounced by the more religious and enlightened
as deceptive.</p>

<p>I. Spiritual magic, which is termed "er-Roo&#7717;&aacute;nee" (vulgo "Row&#7717;&aacute;nee"), chiefly
depends upon the virtues of certain names of God, and passages from the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and
the agency of Angels and Jinn, or Genii. It is of two kinds: High and Low ("'Ilwee"
and "Suflee"), or Divine and Satanic ("Ra&#7717;m&aacute;nee," <i>i. e.</i> relating to "the Compassionate"
[who is God], and "Shey&#7789;&aacute;nee").<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>1. Divine magic is regarded as a sublime science, and is studied only by good men,
and practised only for good purposes. Perfection in this branch of magic consists in the
knowledge of "the most great name" of God ("el-Ism el A&#7841;&#7827;am"); but this knowledge
is imparted to none but the peculiar favourites of Heaven. By virtue of this name, which
was engraved on his seal-ring, Suleym&aacute;n (or Solomon) subjected to his dominion the
Jinn and the birds and the winds, as mentioned in a former note. By pronouncing it,
his minister &Aacute;&#7779;af, also, transported, in an instant, to the presence of his sovereign, in
Jerusalem, the throne of the Queen of Sheba.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> But this was a small miracle to effect
by such means; for, by uttering this name, a man may even raise the dead. Other
names of the Deity, commonly known, are believed to have particular efficacies when
uttered or written; as also are the names of the Prophet; and Angels and good Jinn
are said to be rendered subservient to the purposes of divine magic by means of certain
invocations. Of such names and invocations, together with words unintelligible to the
uninitiated in this science, passages from the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, mysterious combinations of numbers,
and peculiar diagrams and figures, are chiefly composed written charms employed
for good purposes. Enchantment, when used for benevolent purposes, is regarded by
the vulgar as a branch of lawful or divine magic; but not so by the learned; and the
same remark applies to the science of divination.</p>

<p>2. Satanic magic, as its name implies, is a science depending on the agency of the
Devil and the inferior evil Jinn, whose services are obtained by means similar to those
which propitiate, or render subservient, the good Jinn. It is condemned by the Prophet
and all good Muslims, and only practised for bad purposes.&mdash;Enchantment, which
is termed "es-Se&#7717;r," is almost universally acknowledged to be a branch of satanic
magic; but some few persons assert (agreeably with several tales in this work), that it
<i>may</i> be, and by some <i>has</i> been, studied with good intentions, and practised by the aid of
good Jinn; consequently, that there is such a science as <i>good</i> enchantment, which is to
be regarded as a branch of <i>divine</i> or <i>lawful</i> magic. The metamorphoses are said to be
generally effected by means of spells, or invocations to Jinn, accompanied by the
sprinkling of water or dust, &amp;c., on the object to be transformed. Persons are said to
be enchanted in various ways: some, paralyzed, or even deprived of life; others, affected
with irresistible passion for certain objects; others, again, rendered demoniacs; and
some, transformed into brutes, birds, &amp;c. The evil eye is believed to enchant in a very
powerful and distressing manner. This was acknowledged even by the Prophet.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
Diseases and death are often attributed to its influence. Amulets, which are mostly
written charms, of the kind above described, are worn by many Muslims with the view
of counteracting, or preserving from, enchantment; and for the same purpose, many
ridiculous ceremonies are practised.&mdash;Divination, which is termed "el-Kih&aacute;neh," is pronounced,
on the highest authority, to be a branch of satanic magic; though not believed
to be so by all Muslims. According to an assertion of the Prophet, what a fortune-teller
says may sometimes be true; because one of the Jinn steals away the truth, and
carries it to the magician's ear: for the Angels come down to the region next the earth
(the lowest heaven), and mention the works that have been pre-ordained in heaven; and
the Devils (or evil Jinn) listen to what the Angels say, and hear the orders predestined
in heaven, and carry them to the fortune-tellers. It is on such occasions that shooting-stars
are hurled at the Devils.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> It is said that "the diviner obtains the services of the
Shey&#7789;&aacute;n by magic arts, and by names [invoked], and by the burning of perfumes, and
he informs him of secret things: for the Devils, before the mission of the Apostle of
God," it is added, "used to ascend to heaven, and hear words by stealth."<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> That the
evil Jinn are believed still to ascend sufficiently near to the lowest heaven to hear
the conversation of the Angels, and so to assist magicians, appears from the former
quotation, and is asserted by all Muslims. The discovery of hidden treasures, before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>alluded to, is one of the objects for which divination is most studied.&mdash;The mode of
divination called "&#7692;arb el-Mendel" is by some supposed to be effected by the aid of
evil Jinn; but the more enlightened of the Muslims regard it as a branch of natural
magic. Some curious performances of this kind, by means of a fluid mirror of ink,
have been described in my "Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern
Egyptians," and in No. 117 of the "Quarterly Review."<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>There are certain modes of divination which cannot properly be classed under the
head of spiritual magic, but require a place between the account of this science and
that of natural magic.&mdash;The most important of these branches of Kih&aacute;neh is Astrology,
which is called "'Ilm en-Nujoom." This is studied by many Muslims in the present
day; and its professors are often employed by the Arabs to determine a fortunate
period for laying the foundation of a building, commencing a journey, &amp;c.; but more
frequently by the Persians and Turks. The Prophet pronounced astrology to be a
branch of magic.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>&mdash;Another branch of Kih&aacute;neh is Geomancy, called "&#7692;arb er-Raml;"
a mode of divination from certain marks made on sand (whence its appellation), or on
paper; and said to be chiefly founded on astrology.&mdash;The science called "ez-Zijr," or
"el-'Ey&aacute;feh," is a third branch of Kih&aacute;neh; being divination or auguration chiefly from
the motions and positions, or postures, of birds, or of gazelles and other beasts of the
chase. Thus, what was termed a "S&aacute;ne&#7717;," that is, such an animal standing or passing
with its right side towards the spectator, was esteemed among the Arabs as of good
omen; and a "B&aacute;re&#7717;," or an animal of this kind with its left side towards the spectator,
was held as inauspicious.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>&mdash;"El-&#7730;iy&aacute;feh," under which term are included Chiromancy
and its kindred sciences, is a fourth branch of Kih&aacute;neh.&mdash;"Et&middot;Tef&aacute;-ul," or the taking
an omen, particularly a good one, from a name or words accidentally heard or seen, or
chosen from a book, belongs to the same science. The taking a "f&aacute;l," or omen, from
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is generally held to be lawful.&mdash;Various trifling events are considered as
ominous. For instance, a Sul&#7789;&aacute;n quitting his palace with his troops, a standard
happened to strike a "thureiy&agrave;" (a cluster of lamps, so called from resembling the
Pleiades), and broke them: he drew from this an evil omen, and would have relinquished
the expedition; but one of his chief officers said to him, "O our lord, thy
standards have reached the Pleiades;"&mdash;and, being relieved by this remark, he proceeded,
and returned victorious.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>&mdash;The interpretation of dreams, "Ta&#7841;beer el-Men&aacute;m&aacute;t,"
must also be classed among the branches of this science. According to the Prophet, it
is the only branch of divination worthy of dependance. "Good dreams," said he, "are
one of the parts of prophecy," and "nothing else of prophecy remains." "Good dreams
are from God; and false dreams, from the Devil." "When any one of you has a bad
dream, spit three times over your left shoulder, and seek protection with God from the
Devil thrice; and turn from the side on which the dream was, to the other."<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> This
rule is observed by many Muslims. Dreams are generally so fully relied upon by them as
to be sometimes the means of deciding contested points in history and science. The
sight, in a dream, of anything green or white, or of water, is considered auspicious;
anything black or red, or fire, inauspicious.&mdash;The distinction of fortunate and unfortunate
days should also here be mentioned. Thursday and Friday, especially the latter,
are considered fortunate; Monday and Wednesday, doubtful; Sunday, Tuesday, and
Saturday, especially the last, unfortunate. It is said that there are seven evil days in
every [lunar] month; namely, the third, on which &#7730;&aacute;beel (or Cain) killed H&aacute;beel
(Abel); the fifth, on which God cast down Adam from paradise, and afflicted the
people of Yoonus (Jonas), and on which Yoosuf (or Joseph) was cast into the well; the
thirteenth, on which God took away the wealth of Eiyoob (or Job), and afflicted him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>and took away the kingdom from Suleym&aacute;n (or Solomon), and on which the Jews killed
the prophets; the sixteenth, on which God exterminated and buried the people of Loo&#7789;
(or Lot), and transformed three hundred Christians into swine, and Jews into apes,
and on which the Jews sawed asunder Zekereey&agrave; (or Zachariah); the twenty-first, on
which Pharaoh was born, and on which he was drowned, and on which his nation was
afflicted with the plagues; the twenty-fourth, on which Numrood<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> (or Nimrod) killed
seventy women, and cast El-Khaleel (or Abraham) into the fire, and on which was
slaughtered the camel of &#7778;&aacute;le&#7717;; and the twenty-fifth, on which the suffocating wind
was sent upon the people of Hood.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>II. Natural magic, which is called "es-Seemiy&agrave;," is regarded by most persons of the
more enlightened classes of Muslims as altogether a deceptive art, no more worthy of
respect than legerdemain; but it seems to be nearly allied to enchantment; for it is
said to effect, in appearance, the most wonderful transformations, and to cause the most
extraordinary visions; affecting the senses and imagination in a manner similar to
opium. This and other drugs are supposed, by some persons, to be the chief means by
which such illusions are caused; and perfumes, which are generally burnt in these
performances, may operate in a similar manner. As such things are employed in performances
of the kind called "&#7692;arb el-Mendel," before mentioned, these feats are regarded
by many as effected by natural magic, notwithstanding what has been said
above respecting the services of evil Jinn being procured by means of perfumes.&mdash;Alchymy
("el-Keemiy&agrave;") is a branch of natural magic. It is studied by many Muslims
of the present day, and by some of considerable talents and attainments.</p>

<p>The most celebrated of the magicians who have gained notoriety in Egypt during
the course of the last hundred years, was the sheykh A&#7717;mad &#7778;&aacute;doomeh, who flourished
somewhat more than sixty years ago&mdash;I write in 1837. Several persons of Cairo, men
of intelligence and of good education, have related to me various most marvellous stories
of his performances, on the authority of eye-witnesses whom they considered veracious;
but a more credible account of this magician I have found in the work of an excellent
historian of Modern Egypt. This author mentions the sheykh &#7778;&aacute;doomeh as an aged
man, of venerable appearance, who derived his origin from the town of Semennood, in
the Delta, and who acquired a very great and extensive celebrity for his attainments in
spiritual and natural magic, and for holding converse, face to face, with Jinn, and
causing them to appear to other persons, even to the blind, as men acquainted with
him informed the historian. His contemporaries, says this writer, entertained various
opinions respecting him; but, among them, a famous grammarian and general scholar,
the sheykh &#7716;asan El-Kafr&aacute;wee, regarded him as a first-rate saint, who performed evident
miracles; this learned man pronouncing as such the effects of "his legerdemain and
natural magic." His fame he describes as having increased until he was induced to try
an unlucky experiment. A Memlook chief, Yoosuf Bey, saw some magic characters
written on the body of one of his female slaves, and, exasperated by jealousy, commanded
her, with a threat of instant death, to tell him who had done this. She
confessed that a woman had taken her to the sheykh &#7778;&aacute;doomeh, and that he had written
this charm to attract to her the Bey's love. Upon hearing this, he instantly sent some
attendants to seize the magician, and to put him to death, and throw him into the Nile;
which was done.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> But the manner in which the seizure was made, as related to me by
one of my friends, deserves to be mentioned. Several persons, one after another,
endeavoured to lay hold upon him; but every arm that was stretched forth for this
purpose was instantly paralyzed, through a spell muttered by the magician; until a
man behind him thrust a gag into his mouth, and so stopped his enchantments.</p>

<p>Of the stories related to me of &#7778;&aacute;doomeh's miracles, the following will serve as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>specimen:&mdash;In order to give one of his friends a treat, he took him to the distance of
about half an hour's walk into the desert on the north of Cairo; here they both sat
down, upon the pebbly and sandy plain, and, the magician having uttered a spell, they
suddenly found themselves in the midst of a garden, like one of the gardens of paradise,
abounding with flowers and fruit-trees of every kind, springing up from a soil clothed
with verdure brilliant as the emerald, and irrigated by numerous streamlets of the
clearest water. A repast of the most delicious viands and fruits and wines was spread
before them by invisible hands; and they both ate to satiety, taking copious draughts
of the various wines. At length, the magician's guest sank into a deep sleep; and
when he awoke, he found himself again in the pebbly and sandy plain, with &#7778;&aacute;doomeh
still by his side.&mdash;The reader will probably attribute this vision to a dose of opium or
some similar drug; and such I suppose to have been the means employed; for I cannot
doubt the integrity of the narrator, though he would not admit such an explanation;
regarding the whole as an affair of magic, effected by the operation of Jinn, like
similar relations in the present work.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that most of the enchantments described in this work are said
to be performed by <i>women</i>; and reputed <i>witches</i> appear to have been much more
numerous in all countries than <i>wizards</i>. This fact the Muslims readily explain by a
saying of their Prophet:&mdash;That women are deficient in sense and religion:&mdash;whence
they argue that they are more inclined than men to practise what is unlawful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I16" id="I16">16.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Two Grand Festivals.</i> The Muslims observe two grand 'Eeds, or
Festivals, in every year. The first of these immediately follows Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, the month
of abstinence, and lasts three days: it is called the Minor Festival. The other, which
is called the Great Festival, commences on the tenth of
Zu-l-&#7716;ejjeh, the day when the
pilgrims, halting on their return from Mount 'Araf&aacute;t to Mekkeh, in the Valley of Min&egrave;
(vulgarly called Mun&agrave;), perform their sacrifice: the observance of this festival also
continues three days, or four.</p>

<p>Early in the first morning, on each of these festivals, the Muslim is required to
perform a lustration of his whole person, as on the mornings of Friday; and on the
first morning of the Minor Festival, he should break his fast with a few dates or some
other light food; but on the Great Festival, he abstains from food until he has
acquitted himself of the religious duties now to be mentioned. Soon after sunrise, on
the first day of each festival, the men, dressed in new or in their best clothes, repair to
the mosque, or to a particular place appointed for the performance of the prayers of the
'Eed. On going thither, they should repeat, frequently, "God is most great!"&mdash;this,
on the Minor Festival, they should do inaudibly: on the other, aloud. The congregation,
having assembled, repeat the prayers of two rek'ahs; after which, the Kha&#7789;eeb
recites a khu&#7789;beh; <i>i. e.</i> an exhortation and a prayer. On each of these festivals, in the
mosque, or place of prayer, and in the street, and at each other's houses, friends congratulate
and embrace one another; generally paying visits for this purpose; and the
great receive visits from their dependants. The young, on these occasions, kiss the
right hand of the aged; and servants or dependants do the same to their masters or
superiors, unless the latter be of high rank, in which case they kiss the end of the
hanging sleeve, or the skirt of the outer garment. Most of the shops are closed,
excepting those at which eatables and sweet drinks are sold; but the streets are filled
with people in their holiday clothes.</p>

<p>On the Minor Festival, which, as it terminates an arduous fast, is celebrated with
more rejoicing than the other,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> servants and other dependants receive presents of new
articles of clothing from their masters or patrons; and the servant receives presents of
small sums of money from his master's friends, whom, if they do not visit his master, he
goes to congratulate; as well as from any former master, to whom he often takes a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>plateful of ka&#7717;ks. These are sweet cakes, or biscuits, of an annular form, composed of
flour and butter, with a little 'ajameeyeh (which is a thick paste consisting of butter,
honey, a little flour, and some spices) inside. They are also often sent as presents on
this occasion by other people. Another custom required of the faithful on this festival
is the giving of alms.</p>

<p>On the Great Festival, after the prayers of the congregation, every one who can
afford it performs, with his own hand, or by that of a deputy, a sacrifice of a ram, he-goat,
cow or buffalo, or she-camel; part of the meat of which he eats, and part he gives
to the poor, or to his friends or dependants. The ram or goat should be at least one
year old; the cow or buffalo, two years; and the camel, five years; and the victim
should not have any considerable mutilation or infirmity. A cow or buffalo, or a camel,
is a sufficient sacrifice for seven persons. The clothes which were put on new at the
former festival are generally worn on this occasion; and the presents which are given
to servants and others are usually somewhat less.</p>

<p>On each of the two festivals it is also customary, especially with the women, to visit
the tombs of relations. The party generally take with them a palm-branch, and place
it, broken in several pieces, or merely its leaves, upon the tomb or monument; or some,
instead of this, place sweet basil or other flowers. They also usually provide themselves
with sweet cakes, bread, dates, or some other kind of food, to distribute to the poor.
But their first duty, on arriving at the tomb, is to recite the F&aacute;te&#7717;ah (the opening
Chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n), or to employ a person to recite previously a longer chapter;
generally the thirty-sixth (or Soorat Y&aacute;-Seen); or even the whole of the book: or sometimes
the visiters recite the F&aacute;te&#7717;ah, and, after having hired a person to perform a
longer recitation, go away before he commences. The women often stay all the days of
the festival in the cemeteries, either in tents, or in houses of their own, erected there for
their reception on these and other occasions. The tent of each party surrounds the
tomb which is the object of their visit. In the outskirts of the cemeteries, swings and
whirligigs are erected; and story-tellers, dancers, and jugglers, amuse the populace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I17" id="I17">17.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Mode of Slaughtering of Animals for Food.</i> In the old translation,
the sheykh is described as preparing to slaughter the cow with a <i>mallet</i>. This is a
mistake of a serious nature; as the flesh of the victim, if so killed, would be legally
unclean. The Muslims are required to slaughter animals for food in a particular
manner. Sheep, goats, cows or bulls, and buffaloes, must be killed by cutting the
throat, at the part next the head, or any other part; dividing the windpipe, gullet, and
carotid arteries. The camel is to be slaughtered by <i>stabbing</i> the throat at the part next
the breast. Poultry, also, must be killed by cutting the throat; and so must every
tame animal of which the flesh is lawful food. The slaughterer, in every case, must be
a Muslim, a Christian, or a Jew; of either sex. On commencing the operation, he must
say, "In the name of God! God is most great!"&mdash;or at least, "In the name of God!"&mdash;but
not add, "the Compassionate, the Merciful"&mdash;for an obvious reason. Birds or
beasts of the chase may be killed by an arrow, a dog, a hawk, &amp;c.; but the name of
God must be uttered at the time of discharging the arrow, or slipping the dog, &amp;c.
When the beast or bird is not killed at once by the arrow, &amp;c., it must be slaughtered
as soon as possible, in the same manner as sheep and poultry: the law, as well as
humanity, requires this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I18" id="I18">18.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Influence of Eloquence and Tales upon the Arabs.</i> The main incident
upon which this work is founded, the triumph of the fascination of the tongue over a
cruel and unjust determination which nothing else could annul, might be regarded, by
persons unacquainted with the character and literature of the Arabs, as a contrivance
too improbable in its nature; but such is not the case. Perhaps there are no other
people in the world who are such enthusiastic admirers of literature, and so excited by
romantic tales, as those above named. Eloquence, with them, is lawful magic: it
exercises over their minds an irresistible influence. "I swear by God," said their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Prophet, "verily abuse of infidels in verse is worse to them than arrows."<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> This, of
course, alludes to <i>Arab</i> unbelievers.</p>

<p>In the purest, or Heroic Age of Arabic literature, which was anterior to the triumph
of the Mohammadan religion, the conquest which the love of eloquence could achieve
over the sanguinary and vindictive feelings of the Arabs was most remarkably exemplified
in the annual twenty days' fair of 'Ok&aacute;&#7827;, or 'Ok&aacute;&#7693;h. Respecting this fair, I shall
here insert a few particulars borrowed from an author who is at present devoting
talents of the very highest order to the study and illustration of the history and
literature of the early Arabs, and to whose conversation and writings I must acknowledge
myself indebted for most valuable information, which will often be of great
utility to me in this undertaking, as well as in every branch of my Arabic studies.</p>

<p>The fair of 'Ok&aacute;&#7827; "was not only a great mart opened annually to all the tribes of
Arabia; but it was also a literary congress, or rather a general concourse of virtues, of
glory and of poetry, whither the hero-poets resorted to celebrate their exploits in
rhyming verse, and peacefully to contend for every kind of honour. This fair was held
in the district of Mekkeh, between E&#7789;-&#7788;&aacute;&iuml;f and Nakhleh, and was opened at the new
moon of Zu-l-&#7730;a&#7841;deh; that is to say, at the commencement of a period of three sacred
months, during which all war was suspended, and homicide interdicted.... How is it
possible to conceive that men whose wounds were always bleeding, who had always acts
of vengeance to execute, vengeances to dread, could at a certain epoch impose silence
upon their animosities, so as tranquilly to sit by a mortal enemy? How could the
brave who required the blood of a father, a brother, or a son, according to the
phraseology of the desert and of the Bible,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> who long, perhaps, had pursued in vain the
murderer,&mdash;meet him, accost him peacefully at 'Ok&aacute;&#7827;, and only assault with cadences
and rhymes him whose presence alone seemed to accuse him of impotence or cowardice,&mdash;him
whom he was bound to slay, under pain of infamy, after the expiration of the truce?
In fine, how could he hear a panegyric celebrating a glory acquired at his own expense,
and sustain the fire of a thousand looks, and yet appear unmoved? Had the Arabs no
longer any blood in their veins during the continuance of the fair?&mdash;These questions, so
embarrassing, ... were determined [to a great degree], during the age of Arab
paganism, in a manner the most simple and most refined.&mdash;At the fair of 'Ok&aacute;&#7827;, the
heroes were masked [or veiled].&mdash;In the recitations and improvisations, the voice of the
orator was aided by that of a rhapsodist or crier, who was stationed near him, and repeated
his words. There is a similar office in the public prayers: it is that of the
muballigh (transmitter), who is employed to repeat in a loud voice what is said in a
lower tone by the Im&aacute;m. These two facts have been revealed to me by the same
manuscript which I am translating, and upon which I am commenting. The use of the
mask [or veil] might, however, be either adopted or dispensed with, <i>ad libitum</i>; as is
proved by the narratives of a great number of quarrels begun and ended at 'Ok&aacute;&#7827;....
It was in this congress of the Arab poets (and almost every warriour was a poet at the
age which I am considering) that the dialects of Arabia became fused into a magic
language, the language of the &#7716;ej&aacute;z, which Mo&#7717;ammad made use of to subvert the
world; for the triumph of Mo&#7717;ammad is nothing else than the triumph of speech."<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>&mdash;The
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n is regarded by the Arabs as an everlasting miracle, surpassing all others,
appealing to the understanding of every generation by its inimitable eloquence. A
stronger proof of the power of language over their minds could hardly be adduced;
unless it be their being capable of receiving as a credible fact the tradition that both
genii and men were attracted by the eloquent reading of David, when he recited the
Psalms; that the wild beasts and the birds were alike fascinated; and that sometimes
there were borne out from his assembly as many as four hundred corpses of men who
died from the excessive delight with which he thus inspired them.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> It may be added
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>that the recitation, or chanting, of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is a favourite means of amusing the
guests at modern private festivities.</p>

<p>In what may be termed the Middle Age of Arabic literature, commencing from the
triumph of the Mohammadan religion, and extending to the foundation of the Empire
of Baghd&aacute;d, the power of eloquence over the educated classes of the Arabs probably
increased in proportion as it became less familiar to them: for, early in this age, they
began to simplify their spoken language in consequence of their intercourse with
strangers, who could not generally acquire the difficult, old dialect of their conquerors:
this, therefore, then began to be confined to literary compositions. That such a change
took place at this period appears from several anecdotes interspersed in Arabic works.
The Khaleefeh El-Weleed (who reigned near the close of the first century of the
Flight), the son of 'Abd-El-Melik, spoke so corrupt a dialect that he often could not
make himself understood by the Arabs of the desert. A ridiculous instance of the
mistakes occasioned by his use of the simplified language which is now current is
related by Abu-l-Fid&agrave;. The same author adds, that the father and predecessor of this
prince was a man of eloquence, and that he was grieved by the corrupt speech of his
son, which he considered as a defect that incapacitated him to be a future ruler of the
Arabs, as they were still great admirers of purity of speech, though so large a proportion
of them spoke a corrupt dialect; wherefore, he sent him to a house to be instructed
by a grammarian; but after the youth had remained there a long time, he returned to
his father more ignorant than before. Vulgarisms, however, would sometimes escape
from the mouth of 'Abd-El-Melik himself; yet, so sensible was he to eloquence, that,
when a learned man, with whom he was conversing, elegantly informed him of an error
of this kind, he ordered his mouth to be filled with jewels. "These," said his courteous
admonisher, "are things to be treasured up; not to be expended:"&mdash;and for this
delicate hint, he was further rewarded with thirty thousand pieces of silver, and several
costly articles of apparel.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>&mdash;It may be aptly added, that this Khaleefeh was, in the
beginning of his reign, an unjust monarch; and as he thus bore some slight resemblance
to our Shahriy&aacute;r, so was he reclaimed to a sense of his duty by means somewhat similar.
Being, one night, unable to sleep, he called for a person to tell him a story for his
amusement. "O Prince of the Faithful," said the man thus bidden, "there was an owl
in El-M&oacute;&#7779;il, and an owl in El-Ba&#7779;rah; and the owl of El-M&oacute;&#7779;il demanded in marriage,
for her son, the daughter of the owl of El-Ba&#7779;rah: but the owl of El-Ba&#7779;rah said, 'I
will not, unless thou give me, as her dowry, a hundred desolate farms.' 'That I cannot
do,' said the owl of El-M&oacute;&#7779;il, 'at present; but if our sovereign (may God, whose name
be exalted, preserve him!) live one year, I will give thee what thou desirest.'"&mdash;This
simple fable sufficed to rouse the prince from his apathy, and he thenceforward applied
himself to fulfil the duties of his station.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>In the most flourishing age of Arabic poetry and general literature and science,
commencing from the foundation of the Empire of Baghd&aacute;d, and extending to the
conquest of Egypt by the 'Osm&aacute;nlee Turks, the influence of eloquent and entertaining
language upon the character of the Arab sovereigns was particularly exemplified. A
few illustrative anecdotes may here be inserted.</p>

<p>It is related by El-A&#7779;ma'ee, that H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed, at a grand f&ecirc;te which he was
giving, ordered the poet Abu-l-'At&aacute;hiyeh to depict, in verse, the voluptuous enjoyments
of his sovereign. The poet began thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">"Live long in safe enjoyment of thy desires, under the shadow of lofty palaces!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Well said!" exclaimed Er-Rasheed: "and what next?"</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">"May thy wishes be abundantly fulfilled, whether at eventide or in the morning!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Well!" again said the Khaleefeh: "then what next?"</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">"But when the rattling breath struggles in the dark cavity of the chest.</span>
<span class="i0">Then shalt thou know surely, that thou hast been only in the midst of illusions."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>&mdash;Er-Rasheed wept; and Fa&#7693;l, the son of Ya&#7717;y&agrave;, said, "The Prince of the Faithful
sent for thee to divert him, and thou hast plunged him into grief." "Suffer him," said
the prince; "for he hath beheld us in blindness, and it displeased him to increase it."<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>The family of the Barmekees (one of the most brilliant ornaments of which was the
Wezeer Ja&#7841;far, who has been rendered agreeably familiar to us by the many scenes in
which he is introduced in the present work) earned a noble and enduring reputation by
their attachment to literature, and the magnificent rewards they conferred on learned
men. It was peculiarly hard, therefore, that literature contributed to their melancholy
overthrow. Poets were employed by their enemies to compose songs artfully pointed
against them, to be sung before the prince to whom they owed their power. Of one
of these songs, the following lines formed a part:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">"Would that Hind had fulfilled the promises she made us, and healed the disease under which we suffer!</span>
<span class="i0">That she had once, at least, acted for herself! for imbecile, indeed, is he who doth not so."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Yea! By Allah! Imbecile!" exclaimed the Khaleefeh, on hearing these verses:
his jealousy was roused; and his vengeance soon after fell heavily upon his former
favourites.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>One of the Khaleefehs having invited the poets of his day to his palace, a Bedawee,
carrying a water-jar to fill at the river, followed them, and entered with them. The
Khaleefeh, seeing this poor man with the jar on his shoulder, asked him what brought
him thither. He returned for answer these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">"Seeing that this company had girded on the saddles</span>
<span class="i05">To repair to thy overflowing river, I came with my jar."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Khaleefeh, delighted with his answer, gave orders to fill his jar with gold.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>In the present declining age of Arabian learning (which may be said to have commenced
about the period of the conquest of Egypt by the 'Osm&aacute;nlees), literary recreations
still exert a magic influence upon the Arabs. Compositions of a similar nature to
the tales of a Thousand and One Nights (though regarded by the learned as idle stories
unworthy of being classed with their literature) enable numbers of professional story-tellers
to attract crowds of delighted listeners to the coffee-shops of the East; and now
that the original of the present work is printed, and to be purchased at a moderate
price, it will probably soon, in a great measure, supersede the romances of Aboo-Zeyd,
E&#7827;-&#7826;&aacute;hir, and 'Antar. As a proof of the powerful fascinations with which the tales of
a Thousand and One Nights affect the mind of a highly-enlightened Muslim, it may be
mentioned that the latest native historian of Modern Egypt, the sheykh 'Abd-Er-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n
El-Jabartee, so delighted in their perusal that he took the trouble of refining
the language of a copy of them which he possessed, expunging or altering whatever
was grossly offensive to morality without the somewhat redeeming quality of wit, and
adding many faceti&aelig; of his own, and of other literati. What has become of this copy,
I have been unable, though acquainted with several of his friends, to discover.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I19" id="I19">19.</a></span> It is a common custom among the Muslims to give a present to a person
who brings good tidings. The word (bish&aacute;rah) which I render "a reward for bringing
good news," literally signifies merely "good news;" but it is often used, as in this case,
in the former sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I20" id="I20">20.</a></span> A Mohammadan woman is not allowed to show her face to any men
excepting certain near relations and others whom the law prohibits her from marrying.
Who these are will be mentioned in a future note, descriptive of the general laws and
ceremonies of marriage. Respectable females consider it a great disgrace to be seen
unveiled by any men but those above alluded to.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I21" id="I21">21.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the</i> Deen&aacute;r <i>and</i> Dirhem. The standards of gold and silver coin,
among the Arabs, were the deen&aacute;r and the dirhem: therefore, in this work, I call the
former "a piece of gold," and the latter "a piece of silver." Their values have varied
considerably at different periods; but in the present work, we shall sufficiently approximate
to the truth, if we understand the average value of the former to be about ten
shillings or half a guinea; and that of the latter, about sixpence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I22" id="I22">22.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Description of Shops.</i> In Eastern cities, most of the great thoroughfare-streets,
and many others, have a row of shops along each side, not communicating with
the superstructures; which latter are divided into separate lodgings, inhabited by
different families, and seldom by the persons who rent the shops beneath. These streets
are called, in Arabic, "Soo&#7731;s;" and are generally termed by us, "B&aacute;z&aacute;rs." A whole
street of this description, or a portion of such a street, commonly contains only or
chiefly shops appropriated to a particular trade; and is called the Soo&#7731; of that trade.
In general, the shop is a small recess or cell, about six or seven feet high, and between
three and four feet wide, the floor of which is even with the top of a raised seat of
stone or brick, called "ma&#7779;&#7789;abah," between two and three feet high, and about the
same in breadth; upon which the shopkeeper usually sits.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> The front of the shop is
furnished with shutters; which, when closed, at night, are secured by a wooden lock.
Several of the engravings in this work will convey a better notion of shops of different
kinds than a more detailed description.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I23" id="I23">23.</a></span> Distrust in his governors and relations and acquaintance often induces
an Arab to hide his money under the paved floor of a room, or in some other place, in
his house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I24" id="I24">24.</a></span> These words, "I give myself to thee," uttered by a woman to a man,
even without the presence of witnesses, if they cannot be easily procured, render her
his lawful wife, if he replies that he accepts her, and gives her a dowry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I25" id="I25">25.</a></span> I have substituted "Jinneeyeh" (agreeably with the Calcutta edition of
the first two hundred nights, and because the context requires it) for "'Efreeteh,"
which signifies a powerful and evil female genie.&mdash;The tale to which this note refers
may be illustrated by the following anecdote, which was related to me by a Persian
with whom I was acquainted in Cairo, named Abu-l-&#7730;&aacute;sim, a native of Geel&aacute;n, then
superintendent of the B&aacute;sh&agrave;'s Printing-office at Bool&aacute;&#7731;.</p>

<p>One of this person's countrymen, whom he asserted to be a man of indubitable
veracity, was sitting on the roof of a house which he had hired, overlooking the Ganges,
and was passing the closing hour of the day, according to his usual custom, smoking his
Persian pipe, and feasting his eyes by gazing at the beautiful forms of Indian maidens
bathing in the river, when he beheld among them one so lovely that his heart was overpowered
with desire to have her for his wife. At nightfall she came to him, and told
him that she had observed his emotion, and would consent to become his wife; but on
the condition that he should never admit another female to take or share her place, and
that she should only be with him in the night-time. They took the marriage-vow to
each other, with none for their witness but God; and great was his happiness, till, one
evening, he saw again, among a group of girls in the river, another who excited in him
still more powerful emotions. To his surprise, this very form stood before him at the
approach of night. He withstood the temptation, mindful of his marriage-vow: she
used every allurement; but he was resolute. His fair visiter then told him that she
was his wife; that she was a Jinneeyeh; and that she would always thenceforward visit
him in the form of any female whom he might chance to prefer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I26" id="I26">26.</a></span> This form of benediction is almost always added when the Prophet is
mentioned in a book by any of his followers, and often also in conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I27" id="I27">27.</a></span> Perhaps it is needless to explain this proverb by the words of the Bible&mdash;"Vengeance
is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." (Romans, xii. 19.) For the
honour of the Muslims I must say that this maxim is often observed by them, excepting
in cases to which the law of retaliation applies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I28" id="I28">28.</a></span> The houses in Arabian countries generally have flat roofs, upon which, in
the summer, some of the inhabitants often sleep: the interior, therefore, is as accessible
from the roof as from the common entrance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="I29" id="I29">29.</a></span> I here steer a middle course between my usual standard copy&mdash;which
gives the story of the third sheykh more fully than I have done&mdash;and the Calcutta
edition of the first two hundred nights, which omits it altogether, as does also the copy
from which the old translation was made, perhaps on account of its uninteresting
nature.</p>

<h6>COMMENCING WITH PART OF THE THIRD NIGHT, AND ENDING WITH
PART OF THE NINTH.</h6>
<hr />

<h5>THE STORY OF THE FISHERMAN.</h5>

<p>There was a certain fisherman, advanced in age, who had a wife
and three children; and though he was in indigent circumstances, it
was his custom to cast his net, every day, no more than four times.
One day he went forth at the hour of noon to the shore of the sea,
and put down his basket, and cast his net, and waited until it was
motionless in the water, when he drew together its strings, and found
it to be heavy: he pulled, but could not draw it up: so he took
the end of the cord, and knocked a stake into the shore, and tied the
cord to it. He then stripped himself, and dived round the net, and
continued to pull until he drew it out: whereupon he rejoiced, and
put on his clothes; but when he came to examine the net, he found
in it the carcass of an ass. At the sight of this he mourned, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
exclaimed, There is no strength nor power but in God, the High, the
Great! This is a strange piece of fortune!&mdash;And he repeated the
following verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O thou who occupiest thyself in the darkness of night, and in peril! Spare thy
trouble; for the support of Providence is not obtained by toil!<a href="#II1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then disencumbered his net of the dead ass, and wrung it
out; after which he spread it, and descended into the sea, and&mdash;exclaiming,
In the name of God!&mdash;cast it again, and waited till it had
sunk and was still, when he pulled it, and found it more heavy and
more difficult to raise than on the former occasion. He therefore
concluded that it was full of fish: so he tied it, and stripped, and
plunged and dived, and pulled until he raised it, and drew it upon
the shore; when he found in it only a large jar, full of sand and mud;
on seeing which, he was troubled in his heart, and repeated the following
words of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O angry fate, forbear! or, if thou wilt not forbear, relent!</span>
<span class="i0">Neither favour from fortune do I gain, nor profit from the work of my hands,</span>
<span class="i0">I came forth to seek my sustenance, but have found it to be exhausted.</span>
<span class="i0">How many of the ignorant are in splendour! and how many of the wise, in obscurity!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So saying, he threw aside the jar, and wrung out and cleansed his
net; and, begging the forgiveness of God for his impatience, returned
to the sea the third time, and threw the net, and waited till it had sunk
and was motionless: he then drew it out, and found in it a quantity
of broken jars and pots.</p>

<p>Upon this, he raised his head towards heaven, and said, O God,
Thou knowest that I cast not my net more than four times; and I have
now cast it three times! Then&mdash;exclaiming, In the name of God!&mdash;he
cast the net again into the sea, and waited till it was still; when
he attempted to draw it up, but could not, for it clung to the bottom.
And he exclaimed, There is no strength nor power but in God!&mdash;and
stripped himself again, and dived round the net, and pulled it
until he raised it upon the shore; when he opened it, and found in it
a bottle<a href="#II2" class="fnanchor">2</a> of brass, filled with something, and having its mouth closed
with a stopper of lead, bearing the impression of the seal of our lord
Suleym&aacute;n.<a href="#II3" class="fnanchor">3</a> At the sight of this, the fisherman was rejoiced, and said,
This I will sell in the copper-market; for it is worth ten pieces of gold.
He then shook it, and found it to be heavy, and said, I must open
it, and see what is in it, and store it in my bag; and then I will sell
the bottle in the copper-market. So he took out a knife, and picked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
at the lead until he extracted it from the bottle. He then laid the
bottle on the ground, and shook it, that its contents might pour out;
but there came forth from it nothing but smoke, which ascended
towards the sky, and spread over the face of the earth; at which he
wondered excessively. And after a little while, the smoke collected
together, and was condensed, and then became agitated, and was converted
into an 'Efreet, whose head was in the clouds, while his feet
rested upon the ground:<a href="#II4" class="fnanchor">4</a> his head was like a dome: his hands were
like winnowing forks;<a href="#II5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and his legs, like masts: his mouth resembled
a cavern: his teeth were like stones; his nostrils, like trumpets;<a href="#II6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
and his eyes, like lamps; and he had dishevelled and dust-coloured
hair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>When the fisherman beheld this 'Efreet, the muscles of his sides
quivered, his teeth were locked together, his spittle dried up, and he
saw not his way. The 'Efreet, as soon as he perceived him, exclaimed,
There is no deity but God: Suleym&aacute;n is the Prophet of God. O
Prophet of God, slay me not; for I will never again oppose thee in
word, or rebel against thee in deed!&mdash;O M&aacute;rid,<a href="#II7" class="fnanchor">7</a> said the fisherman,
dost thou say, Suleym&aacute;n is the Prophet of God? Suleym&aacute;n hath
been dead a thousand and eight hundred years; and we are now in
the end of time. What is thy history, and what is thy tale, and what
was the cause of thy entering this bottle? When the M&aacute;rid heard
these words of the fisherman, he said, There is no deity but God!
Receive news, O fisherman!&mdash;Of what, said the fisherman, dost thou
give me news? He answered, Of thy being instantly put to a most
cruel death. The fisherman exclaimed, Thou deservest, for this news,
O master of the 'Efreets, the withdrawal of protection from thee, O
thou remote!<a href="#II8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Wherefore wouldst thou kill me? and what requires
thy killing me, when I have liberated thee from the bottle, and rescued
thee from the bottom of the sea, and brought thee up upon the dry
land?&mdash;The 'Efreet answered, Choose what kind of death thou wilt
die, and in what manner thou shalt be killed.&mdash;What is my offence,
said the fisherman, that this should be my recompense from thee?
The 'Efreet replied, Hear my story, O fisherman.&mdash;Tell it then, said
the fisherman, and be short in thy words; for my soul hath sunk down
to my feet.</p>

<p>Know then, said he, that I am one of the heretical Jinn: I
rebelled against Suleym&aacute;n the son of D&aacute;ood: I and &#7778;akhr the Jinnee;<a href="#II9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
and he sent to me his Wezeer, &Aacute;&#7779;af the son of Barkhiy&agrave;, who
came upon me forcibly, and took me to him in bonds, and placed me
before him: and when Suleym&aacute;n saw me, he offered up a prayer for
protection against me, and exhorted me to embrace the faith, and to
submit to his authority; but I refused; upon which he called for this
bottle, and confined me in it, and closed it upon me with the leaden
stopper, which he stamped with the Most Great Name: he then gave
orders to the Jinn, who carried me away, and threw me into the midst
of the sea. There I remained a hundred years; and I said in my
heart, Whosoever shall liberate me, I will enrich him for ever:&mdash;but
the hundred years passed over me, and no one liberated me: and I
entered upon another hundred years; and I said, Whosoever shall
liberate me, I will open to him the treasures of the earth;&mdash;but no
one did so: and four hundred years more passed over me, and I said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Whosoever shall liberate me, I will perform for him three wants:&mdash;but
still no one liberated me. I then fell into a violent rage, and said
within myself, Whosoever shall liberate me now, I will kill him; and
only suffer him to choose in what manner he will die. And lo, now
thou hast liberated me, and I have given thee thy choice of the manner
in which thou wilt die.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f36" id="f36"></a><img src="images/fig36.png" width="500" height="528" alt="The Fisherman enclosing the 'Efreet in the Bottle" title="The Fisherman enclosing the 'Efreet in the Bottle" /></div>

<p>When the fisherman had heard the story of the 'Efreet, he exclaimed,
O Allah! that I should not have liberated thee but in such
a time as this! Then said he to the 'Efreet, Pardon me, and kill me
not, and so may God pardon thee; and destroy me not, lest God give
power over thee to one who will destroy thee. The M&aacute;rid answered,
I must positively kill thee; therefore choose by what manner of death
thou wilt die. The fisherman then felt assured of his death; but he
again implored the 'Efreet, saying, Pardon me by way of gratitude for
my liberating thee.&mdash;Why, answered the 'Efreet, I am not going to
kill thee but for that very reason, because thou hast liberated me.&mdash;O
Sheykh of the 'Efreets, said the fisherman, do I act kindly towards
thee, and dost thou recompense me with baseness? But the proverb
lieth not that saith,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We did good to them, and they returned us the contrary; and such, by my life, is the conduct of the wicked.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus he who acteth kindly to the undeserving is recompensed in the same manner as the aider of Umm-'&Aacute;mir.<a href="#II10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The 'Efreet, when he heard these words, answered by saying, Covet
not life, for thy death is unavoidable. Then said the fisherman within
himself, This is a Jinnee, and I am a man; and God hath given me
sound reason; therefore, I will now plot his destruction with my art
and reason, like as he hath plotted with his cunning and perfidy. So
he said to the 'Efreet, Hast thou determined to kill me? He answered,
Yes. Then said he, By the Most Great Name engraved upon the seal
of Suleym&aacute;n, I will ask thee one question; and wilt thou answer it to
me truly? On hearing the mention of the Most Great Name, the
'Efreet was agitated, and trembled, and replied, Yes; ask, and be brief.
The fisherman then said, How wast thou in this bottle? It will not
contain thy hand or thy foot; how then can it contain thy whole  body?&mdash;Dost
thou not believe that I was in it? said the 'Efreet. The
fisherman answered, I will never believe thee until I see thee in it.
Upon this, the 'Efreet shook, and became converted again into smoke,
which rose to the sky, and then became condensed, and entered the
bottle by little and little, until it was all enclosed; when the fisherman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
hastily snatched the sealed leaden stopper, and, having replaced it in
the mouth of the bottle, called out to the 'Efreet, and said, Choose
in what manner of death thou wilt die. I will assuredly throw thee
here into the sea, and build me a house on this spot; and whosoever
shall come here, I will prevent his fishing in this place, and will say to
him, Here is an 'Efreet, who, to any person that liberates him, will
propose various kinds of death, and then give him his choice of one
of them. On hearing these words of the fisherman, the 'Efreet endeavoured
to escape; but could not, finding himself restrained by the
impression of the seal of Suleym&aacute;n, and thus imprisoned by the fisherman
as the vilest and filthiest and least of 'Efreets. The fisherman
then took the bottle to the brink of the sea. The 'Efreet exclaimed,
Nay! nay!&mdash;to which the fisherman answered, Yea, without fail! yea,
without fail! The M&aacute;rid then addressing him with a soft voice and
humble manner, said, What dost thou intend to do with me, O fisherman?
He answered, I will throw thee into the sea; and if thou hast
been there a thousand and eight hundred years, I will make thee to
remain there until the hour of judgment. Did I not say to thee, Spare
me, and so may God spare thee; and destroy me not, lest God destroy
thee? But thou didst reject my petition, and wouldest nothing but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
treachery; therefore God hath caused thee to fall into my hand, and I
have betrayed thee.&mdash;Open to me, said the 'Efreet, that I may confer
benefits upon thee. The fisherman replied, Thou liest, thou accursed!
I and thou are like the Wezeer of King Yoon&aacute;n<a href="#II11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and the sage Doob&aacute;n.<a href="#II12" class="fnanchor">12</a>&mdash;What,
said the 'Efreet, was the case of the Wezeer of King Yoon&aacute;n
and the sage Doob&aacute;n, and what is their story? The fisherman
answered as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF KING YOON&Aacute;N AND THE SAGE DOOB&Aacute;N.</h5>

<p>Know, O 'Efreet, that there was, in former times, in the country
of the Persians,<a href="#II13" class="fnanchor">13</a> a monarch who was called King Yoon&aacute;n, possessing
great treasures and numerous forces, valiant, and having troops of
every description; but he was afflicted with leprosy, which the physicians
and sages had failed to remove; neither their potions, nor powders,
nor ointments were of any benefit to him; and none of the physicians
was able to cure him. At length there arrived at the city of this
king a great sage, stricken in years, who was called the sage Doob&aacute;n:
he was acquainted with ancient Greek, Persian, modern Greek, Arabic,
and Syriac books, and with medicine and astrology, both with respect
to their scientific principles and the rules of their practical applications
for good and evil; as well as the properties of plants, dried and fresh,
the injurious and the useful: he was versed in the wisdom of the
philosophers, and embraced a knowledge of all the medical and other
sciences.</p>

<p>After this sage had arrived in the city, and remained in it a few
days, he heard of the case of the King, of the leprosy with which God
had afflicted him, and that the physicians and men of science had
failed to cure him. In consequence of this information, he passed the
next night in deep study; and when the morning came, and diffused
its light, and the sun saluted the Ornament of the Good,<a href="#II14" class="fnanchor">14</a> he attired
himself in the richest of his apparel, and presented himself before the
King. Having kissed the ground before him, and offered up a prayer
for the continuance of his power and happiness, and greeted him in
the best manner he was able, he informed him who he was, and said,
O King, I have heard of the disease which hath attacked thy person,
and that many of the physicians are unacquainted with the means of
removing it; and I will cure thee without giving thee to drink any
potion, or anointing thee with ointment. When King Yoon&aacute;n heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
his words, he wondered, and said to him, How wilt thou do this?
By Allah, if thou cure me, I will enrich thee and thy children's
children, and I will heap favours upon thee, and whatever thou shalt
desire shall be thine, and thou shalt be my companion and my friend.&mdash;He
then bestowed upon him a robe of honour,<a href="#II15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and other presents,
and said to him, Wilt thou cure me of this disease without potion or
ointment? He answered, Yes; I will cure thee without any discomfort
to thy person. And the King was extremely astonished, and said, O
Sage, at what time, and on what day, shall that which thou hast
proposed to me be done? Hasten it, O my Son.&mdash;He answered, I
hear and obey.</p>

<p>He then went out from the presence of the King, and hired a
house, in which he deposited his books, and medicines, and drugs.
Having done this, he selected certain of his medicines and drugs,
and made a goff-stick, with a hollow handle, into which he introduced
them; after which he made a ball for it, skilfully adapted;
and on the following day, after he had finished these, he went again to
the King, and kissed the ground before him, and directed him to repair
to the horse-course, and to play with the ball and goff-stick. The
King, attended by his Emeers and Chamberlains and Wezeers, went
thither, and, as soon as he arrived there, the sage Doob&aacute;n presented
himself before him, and handed to him the goff-stick, saying, Take
this goff-stick, and grasp it thus, and ride along the horse-course,
and strike the ball with it with all thy force, until the palm of thy
hand and thy whole body become moist with perspiration, when the
medicine will penetrate into thy hand, and pervade thy whole body; and
when thou hast done this, and the medicine remains in thee, return to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
thy palace, and enter the bath,<a href="#II16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and wash thyself, and sleep: then
shalt thou find thyself cured: and peace be on thee. So King Yoon&aacute;n
took the goff-stick from the sage, and grasped it in his hand, and
mounted his horse; and the ball was thrown before him, and he urged
his horse after it until he overtook it, when he struck it with all his
force; and when he had continued this exercise as long as was necessary,
and bathed and slept, he looked upon his skin, and not a vestige
of the leprosy remained: it was clear as white silver. Upon this he
rejoiced exceedingly; his heart was dilated, and he was full of
happiness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f37" id="f37"></a><img src="images/fig37.png" width="550" height="281" alt="King Yoon&aacute;n playing at Goff" title="King Yoon&aacute;n playing at Goff" /></div>

<p>On the following morning he entered the council-chamber, and
sat upon his throne; and the Chamberlains and great officers of his
court came before him. The sage Doob&aacute;n also presented himself; and
when the King saw him, he rose to him in haste, and seated him by
his side. Services of food were then spread before them, and the sage
ate with the King, and remained as his guest all the day;<a href="#II17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and when
the night approached, the King gave him two thousand pieces of gold,
besides dresses of honour and other presents, and mounted him on his
own horse, and so the sage returned to his house.<a href="#II18" class="fnanchor">18</a> And the King was
astonished at his skill; saying, This man hath cured me by an external
process, without anointing me with ointment: by Allah, this is consummate
science; and it is incumbent on me to bestow favours and
honours upon him, and to make him my companion and familiar
friend as long as I live. He passed the night happy and joyful on
account of his recovery, and when he arose, he went forth again, and
sat upon his throne; the officers of his court standing before him,
and the Emeers and Wezeers sitting on his right hand and on his
left; and he called for the sage Doob&aacute;n, who came, and kissed the
ground before him; and the King rose, and seated him by his side,
and ate with him, and greeted him with compliments: he bestowed
upon him again a robe of honour and other presents, and, after conversing
with him till the approach of night, gave orders that five other
robes of honour should be given to him, and a thousand pieces of gold;
and the sage departed, and returned to his house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; position: relative;"><a name="f38" id="f38"></a><img src="images/fig38.png" width="400" height="603" alt="Doob&aacute;n in his Dress of Honour" title="Doob&aacute;n in his Dress of Honour" /></div>

<p>Again, when the next morning came, the King went as usual to
his council-chamber, and the Emeers and Wezeers and Chamberlains
surrounded him. Now there was, among his Wezeers, one of ill
aspect, and of evil star;<a href="#II19" class="fnanchor">19</a> sordid, avaricious, and of an envious and
malicious disposition; and when he saw that the King had made the
sage Doob&aacute;n his friend, and bestowed upon him these favours, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
envied him this distinction, and meditated evil against him; agreeably
with the adage which saith, There is no one void of envy;<a href="#II20" class="fnanchor">20</a>&mdash;and
another, which saith, Tyranny lurketh in the soul: power manifesteth
it, and weakness concealeth it. So he approached the King, and kissed
the ground before him, and said, O King of the age, thou art he whose
goodness extendeth to all men, and I have an important piece of
advice to give thee: if I were to conceal it from thee, I should be a
base-born wretch: therefore, if thou order me to impart it, I will do
so. The King, disturbed by these words of the Wezeer, said, What is
thy advice? He answered, O glorious King, it hath been said, by the
ancients, He who looketh not to results, fortune will not attend him:&mdash;now
I have seen the King in a way that is not right; since he hath
bestowed favours upon his enemy, and upon him who desireth the
downfall of his dominion: he hath treated him with kindness, and
honoured him with the highest honours, and admitted him to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
closest intimacy: I therefore fear, for the King, the consequence of
this conduct.&mdash;At this the King was troubled, and his countenance
changed; and he said, Who is he whom thou regardest as mine enemy,
and to whom I shew kindness? He replied, O King, if thou hast
been asleep, awake! I allude to the sage Doob&aacute;n.&mdash;The King said,
He is my intimate companion, and the dearest of men in my estimation;
for he restored me by a thing that I merely held in my hand,
and cured me of my disease which the physicians were unable to
remove, and there is not now to be found one like to him in the whole
world, from west to east. Wherefore, then, dost thou utter these
words against him? I will, from this day, appoint him a regular
salary and maintenance, and give him every month a thousand pieces
of gold; and if I gave him a share of my kingdom it were but a
small thing to do unto him. I do not think that thou hast said this
from any other motive than that of envy. If I did what thou desirest,
I should repent after it, as the man repented who killed his parrot.<a href="#II21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; position: relative;"><a name="f39" id="f39"></a><img src="images/fig39.png" width="300" height="338" alt="The Intelligent Parrot" title="The Intelligent Parrot" /></div>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE HUSBAND AND THE PARROT.</h5>

<p>There was a certain merchant, of an excessively jealous disposition,
having a wife endowed with perfect beauty, who had prevented him
from leaving his home; but an event happened which obliged him to
make a journey; and when he found his doing so to be indispensable,
he went to the market in which birds were sold, and bought
a parrot, which he placed in his house to act as a spy, that, on his
return, she might inform him of what passed during his absence; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
this parrot was cunning and intelligent, and remembered whatever she
heard.<a href="#II22" class="fnanchor">22</a> So, when he had made his journey, and accomplished his
business, he returned, and caused the parrot to be brought to him, and
asked her respecting the conduct of his wife. She answered, Thy wife
has a lover, who visited her every night during thy absence:&mdash;and
when the man heard this, he fell into a violent rage, and went to his
wife, and gave her a severe beating.</p>

<p>The woman imagined that one of the female slaves had informed
him of what had passed between her and her paramour during his
absence: she therefore called them together, and made them swear;
and they all swore that they had not told their master anything of
the matter; but confessed that they had heard the parrot relate to him
what had passed. Having thus established, on the testimony of the
slaves, the fact of the parrot's having informed her husband of her
intrigue, she ordered one of these slaves to grind with a hand-mill
under the cage, another to sprinkle water from above, and a third
to move a mirror from side to side, during the next night on which
her husband was absent; and on the following morning, when the
man returned from an entertainment at which he had been present, and
inquired again of the parrot what had passed that night during his
absence, the bird answered, O my master, I could neither see nor
hear anything, on account of the excessive darkness, and thunder, and
lightning, and rain. Now this happened during summer: so he said
to her, What strange words are these? It is now summer, when
nothing of what thou hast described ever happens.&mdash;The parrot,
however, swore by Allah the Great that what she had said was true;
and that it had so happened: upon which the man, not understanding
the case, nor knowing the plot, became violently enraged, and took
out the bird from the cage, and threw her down upon the ground with
such violence that he killed her.</p>

<p>But after some days, one of his female slaves informed him of the
truth; yet he would not believe it, until he saw his wife's paramour
going out from his house; when he drew his sword,<a href="#II23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and slew the
traitor by a blow on the back of his neck: so also did he to his
treacherous wife; and thus both of them went, laden with the sin
which they had committed, to the fire; and the merchant discovered
that the parrot had informed him truly of what she had seen; and he
mourned grievously for her loss.</p>

<p>When the Wezeer heard these words of King Yoon&aacute;n, he said, O
King of great dignity, what hath this crafty sage&mdash;this man from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
whom nought but mischief proceedeth&mdash;done unto me, that I should
be his enemy, and speak evil of him, and plot with thee to destroy
him? I have informed thee respecting him in compassion for thee,
and in fear of his despoiling thee of thy happiness; and if my words
be not true, destroy me, as the Wezeer of Es-Sindib&aacute;d was destroyed.&mdash;The
King asked, How was that? And the Wezeer thus answered:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE ENVIOUS WEZEER AND THE PRINCE
AND THE GHOOLEH.</h5>

<p>The King above mentioned had a son who was ardently fond of
the chase;<a href="#II24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and he had a Wezeer whom he charged to be always with
this son wherever he went. One day the son went forth to hunt,
and his father's Wezeer was with him; and as they rode together, they
saw a great wild beast; upon which the Wezeer exclaimed to the
Prince, Away after this wild beast! The King's son pursued it until
he was out of the sight of his attendants, and the beast also escaped
from before his eyes in the desert; and while the Prince wandered in
perplexity, not knowing whither to direct his course, he met in his way
a damsel, who was weeping. He said to her, Who art thou?&mdash;and
she answered, I am a daughter of one of the kings of India; I was in
the desert, and slumber overtook me, and I fell from my horse in a
state of insensibility, and being thus separated from my attendants, I
lost my way. The Prince, on hearing this, pitied her forlorn state, and
placed her behind him on his horse; and as they proceeded, they passed
by a ruin,<a href="#II25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and the damsel said to him, O my master, I would alight
here for a little while. The Prince therefore lifted her from his horse at
this ruin; but she delayed so long to return, that he wondered wherefore
she had loitered so, and entering after her, without her knowledge,
perceived that she was a Ghooleh,<a href="#II26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and heard her say, My children, I
have brought you to-day a fat young man:&mdash;on which they exclaimed,
Bring him in to us, O mother! that we may fill our stomachs with his
flesh. When the Prince heard their words, he felt assured of destruction;
the muscles of his sides quivered, and fear overcame him, and he
retreated. The Ghooleh then came forth, and, seeing that he appeared
alarmed and fearful, and that he was trembling, said to him, Wherefore
dost thou fear? He answered, I have an enemy of whom I am in
fear. The Ghooleh said, Thou assertest thyself to be the son of the
King. He replied, Yes.&mdash;Then, said she, wherefore dost thou not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
give some money to thine enemy, and so conciliate him? He answered,
He will not be appeased with money, nor with anything but life; and
therefore do I fear him: I am an injured man. She then said to him,
If thou be an injured man, as thou affirmest, beg aid of God against
thine oppressor, and He will avert from thee his mischievous design, and
that of every other person whom thou fearest. Upon this, therefore, the
Prince raised his head towards heaven, and said, O thou who answerest
the distressed when he prayeth to Thee, and dispellest evil, assist me,
and cause mine enemy to depart from me; for Thou art able to do
whatsoever Thou wilt!&mdash;and the Ghooleh no sooner heard his prayer,
than she departed from him. The Prince then returned to his father,
and informed him of the conduct of the Wezeer; upon which the
King gave orders that the minister should be put to death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f40" id="f40"></a><img src="images/fig40.png" width="550" height="611" alt="The Prince Meeting the Ghooleh" title="The Prince Meeting the Ghooleh" /></div>

<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF KING YOON&Aacute;N AND THE
SAGE DOOB&Aacute;N.</h5>

<p>And thou, O King, continued the Wezeer of King Yoon&aacute;n, if
thou trust in this sage, he will kill thee in the foulest manner. If
thou continue to bestow favours upon him, and to make him thine
intimate companion, he will plot thy destruction. Dost thou not see
that he hath cured thee of the disease by external means, by a thing
that thou heldest in thy hand? Therefore thou art not secure
against his killing thee by a thing that thou shalt hold in the same
manner.&mdash;King Yoon&aacute;n answered, Thou hast spoken truth: the case
is as thou hast said, O faithful Wezeer: it is probable that this sage
came as a spy to accomplish my death; and if he cured me by a thing
I held in my hand, he may destroy me by a thing that I may smell:
what then, O Wezeer, shall be done respecting him? The Wezeer
answered, Send to him immediately, and desire him to come hither;
and when he is come, strike off his head, and so shalt thou avert from
thee his evil design, and be secure from him. Betray him before he
betray thee.&mdash;The King said, Thou hast spoken right.</p>

<p>Immediately, therefore, he sent for the sage, who came, full of
joy, not knowing what the Compassionate<a href="#II27" class="fnanchor">27</a> had decreed against him,
and addressed the King with these words of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If I fail any day to render thee due thanks, tell me for whom I have composed my verse and prose.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast loaded me with favours unsolicited, bestowed without delay on thy part, or excuse.</span>
<span class="i0">How then should I abstain from praising thee as thou deservest, and lauding thee both with my heart and voice?</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, I will thank thee for thy benefits conferred upon me: they are light upon my tongue, though weighty to my back.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Knowest thou, said the King, wherefore I have summoned thee?
The sage answered, None knoweth what is secret but God, whose name
be exalted! Then said the King, I have summoned thee that I may
take away thy life. The sage, in the utmost astonishment at this announcement,
said, O King, wherefore wouldst thou kill me, and what
offence hath been committed by me? The King answered, It hath
been told me that thou art a spy, and that thou hast come hither to
kill me: but I will prevent thee by killing thee first:&mdash;and so saying,
he called out to the executioner, Strike off the head of this traitor, and
relieve me from his wickedness,&mdash;Spare me, said the sage, and so may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
God spare thee; and destroy me not, lest God destroy thee.&mdash;And he
repeated these words several times, like as I did, O 'Efreet; but thou
wouldst not let me go, desiring to destroy me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; position: relative;"><a name="f41" id="f41"></a><img src="images/fig41.png" width="300" height="332" alt="Doob&aacute;n and the Executioner" title="Doob&aacute;n and the Executioner" /></div>

<p>King Yoon&aacute;n then said to the sage Doob&aacute;n, I shall not be secure
unless I kill thee; for thou curedst me by a thing that I held in my
hand, and I have no security against thy killing me by a thing that I
may smell, or by some other means.&mdash;O King, said the sage, is this my
recompense from thee? Dost thou return evil for good?&mdash;The King
answered, Thou must be slain without delay. When the sage, therefore,
was convinced that the King intended to put him to death, and
that his fate was inevitable, he lamented the benefit that he had done
to the undeserving. The executioner then advanced, and bandaged his
eyes, and, having drawn his sword, said, Give permission. Upon this
the sage wept, and said again, Spare me, and so may God spare thee;
and destroy me not, lest God destroy thee! Wouldst thou return me
the recompense of the crocodile?&mdash;What, said the King, is the story
of the crocodile? The sage answered, I cannot relate it while in this
condition;<a href="#II28" class="fnanchor">28</a> but I conjure thee by Allah to spare me, and so may He
spare thee. And he wept bitterly. Then one of the chief officers of
the King arose, and said, O King, give up to me the blood of this
sage; for we have not seen him commit any offence against thee; nor
have we seen him do aught but cure thee of thy disease, which wearied
the other physicians and sages. The King answered, Ye know not
the reason wherefore I would kill the sage: it is this, that if I suffered
him to live, I should myself inevitably perish; for he who cured me
of the disease under which I suffered by a thing that I held in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
hand, may kill me by a thing that I may smell; and I fear that he
would do so, and would receive an appointment on account of it;
seeing that it is probable he is a spy who hath come hither to kill
me; I must therefore kill him, and then shall I feel myself safe.&mdash;The
sage then said again, Spare me, and so may God spare thee; and
destroy me not, lest God destroy thee.</p>

<p>But he now felt certain, O 'Efreet, that the King would put him
to death, and that there was no escape for him; so he said, O King,
if my death is indispensable, grant me some respite, that I may return
to my house, and acquit myself of my duties, and give directions to
my family and neighbours to bury me, and dispose of my medical
books; and among my books is one of most especial value, which I
offer as a present to thee, that thou mayest treasure it in thy library.&mdash;And
what, said the King, is this book? He answered, It contains
things not to be enumerated; and the smallest of the secret virtues
that it possesses is this; that, when thou hast cut off my head, if thou
open this book, and count three leaves, and then read three lines on
the page to the left, the head will speak to thee, and answer whatever
thou shalt ask. At this the King was excessively astonished, and
shook with delight, and said to him, O Sage, when I have cut off thy
head will it speak? He answered, Yes, O King; and this is a wonderful
thing.</p>

<p>The King then sent him in the custody of guards; and the sage
descended to his house, and settled all his affairs on that day; and on
the following day he went up to the court: and the Emeers and
Wezeers, and Chamberlains and Deputies, and all the great officers
of the state, went thither also: and the court resembled a flower-garden.<a href="#II29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
And when the sage had entered, he presented himself before
the King, bearing an old book, and a small pot containing a powder:
and he sat down, and said, Bring me a tray. So they brought him
one; and he poured out the powder into it, and spread it. He then
said, O King, take this book, and do nothing with it until thou hast
cut off my head; and when thou hast done so, place it upon this tray,
and order some one to press it down upon the powder; and when this
is done, the blood will be stanched: then open the book. As soon
as the sage had said this, the King gave orders to strike off his head;
and it was done. The King then opened the book, and found that its
leaves were stuck together; so he put his finger to his mouth, and
moistened it with his spittle, and opened the first leaf, and the second,
and the third; but the leaves were not opened without difficulty. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
opened six leaves, and looked at them; but found upon them no writing.
So he said, O Sage, there is nothing written in it. The head of the
sage answered, Turn over more leaves. The King did so; and in a
little while, the poison penetrated into his system; for the book was
poisoned; and the King fell back, and cried out, The poison hath
penetrated into me!&mdash;and upon this, the head of the sage Doob&aacute;n
repeated these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They made use of their power, and used it tyrannically; and soon it became as though it never had existed.</span>
<span class="i0">Had they acted equitably, they had experienced equity; but they oppressed; wherefore fortune oppressed them with calamities and trials.</span>
<span class="i0">Then did the case itself announce to them, This is the reward of your conduct, and fortune is blameless.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when the head of the sage Doob&aacute;n had uttered these words,
the King immediately fell down dead.<a href="#II30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f42" id="f42"></a><img src="images/fig42.png" width="550" height="311" alt="The Death of King Yoon&aacute;n" title="The Death of King Yoon&aacute;n" /></div>

<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF THE FISHERMAN.</h5>

<p>Now, O 'Efreet, continued the fisherman, know that if King
Yoon&aacute;n had spared the sage Doob&aacute;n, God had spared him; but he
refused, and desired his destruction; therefore God destroyed him: and
thou, O 'Efreet, if thou hadst spared me, God had spared thee, and I
had spared thee; but thou desiredst my death; therefore will I put
thee to death imprisoned in this bottle, and will throw thee here into
the sea. The M&aacute;rid, upon this, cried out, and said, I conjure thee by
Allah, O fisherman, that thou do it not: spare me in generosity, and
be not angry with me for what I did; but if I have done evil, do thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
good, according to the proverb,&mdash;O thou benefactor of him who hath
done evil, the action that he hath done is sufficient for him:&mdash;do not
therefore as Um&aacute;meh did to '&Aacute;tikeh.&mdash;And what, said the fisherman,
was their case? The 'Efreet answered, This is not a time for telling
stories, when I am in this prison; but when thou liberatest me, I will
relate to thee their case.<a href="#II31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The fisherman said, Thou must be thrown
into the sea, and there shall be no way of escape for thee from it; for I
endeavoured to propitiate thee, and humbled myself before thee, yet
thou wouldest nothing but my destruction, though I had committed
no offence to deserve it, and had done no evil to thee whatever, but
only good, delivering thee from thy confinement; and when thou didst
thus unto me, I perceived that thou wast radically corrupt: and I
would have thee know, that my motive for throwing thee into this sea,
is, that I may acquaint with thy story every one that shall take thee
out, and caution him against thee, that he may cast thee in again:
thus shalt thou remain in this sea to the end of time, and experience
varieties of torment.&mdash;The 'Efreet then said, Liberate me, for this is
an opportunity for thee to display humanity; and I vow to thee that
I will never do thee harm; but, on the contrary, will do thee a service
that shall enrich thee for ever.</p>

<p>Upon this the fisherman accepted his covenant that he would not
hurt him, but that he would do him good; and when he had bound
him by oaths and vows, and made him swear by the Most Great Name
of God, he opened to him; and the smoke ascended until it had all
come forth, and then collected together, and became, as before, an
'Efreet of hideous form. The 'Efreet then kicked the bottle into
the sea. When the fisherman saw him do this, he made sure of
destruction, and said, This is no sign of good:&mdash;but afterwards he
fortified his heart, and said, O 'Efreet, God, whose name be exalted,
hath said, Perform the covenant, for the covenant shall be inquired
into:<a href="#II32" class="fnanchor">32</a>&mdash;and thou has covenanted with me, and sworn that thou wilt
not act treacherously towards me; therefore, if thou so act, God will
recompense thee; for He is jealous; He respiteth, but suffereth not to
escape; and remember that I said to thee as said the sage Doob&aacute;n to
King Yoon&aacute;n, Spare me, and so may God spare thee.</p>

<p>The 'Efreet laughed, and, walking on before him, said, O fisherman,
follow me. The fisherman did so, not believing in his escape, until
they had quitted the neighbourhood of the city, and ascended a
mountain, and descended into a wide desert tract, in the midst of
which was a lake of water. Here the 'Efreet stopped, and ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the fisherman to cast his net and take some fish; and the fisherman,
looking into the lake, saw in it fish of different colours, white and red
and blue and yellow; at which he was astonished; and he cast his net,
and drew it in, and found in it four fish, each fish of a different
colour from the others, at the sight of which he rejoiced. The
'Efreet then said to him, Take them to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n,<a href="#II33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and present them
to him, and he will give thee what will enrich thee; and for the sake
of God accept my excuse, for, at present, I know no other way of rewarding
thee, having been in the sea a thousand and eight hundred
years, and not seen the surface of the earth until now: but take not
fish from the lake more than once each day: and now I commend
thee to the care of God.&mdash;Having thus said, he struck the earth with
his feet, and it clove asunder, and swallowed him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f43" id="f43"></a><img src="images/fig43.png" width="550" height="290" alt="The Fish of Four Colours" title="The Fish of Four Colours" /></div>

<p>The fisherman then went back to the city, wondering at all that
had befallen him with the 'Efreet, and carried the fish to his house;
and he took an earthen bowl, and, having filled it with water, put the
fish into it; and they struggled in the water: and when he had done
this, he placed the bowl upon his head, and repaired to the King's
palace, as the 'Efreet had commanded him, and, going up unto the
King, presented to him the fish; and the King was excessively
astonished at them, for he had never seen any like them in the course
of his life; and he said, Give these fish to the slave cook-maid.
This maid had been sent as a present to him by the King of the
Greeks, three days before; and he had not yet tried her skill. The
Wezeer, therefore, ordered her to fry the fish, and said to her, O
maid, the King saith unto thee, I have not reserved my tear but for
the time of my difficulty:&mdash;to-day, then, gratify us by a specimen of
thy excellent cookery, for a person hath brought these fish as a present
to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n. After having thus charged her, the Wezeer returned,
and the King ordered him to give the fisherman four hundred pieces of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
gold: so the Wezeer gave them to him; and he took them in his lap,
and returned to his home and his wife, joyful and happy, and bought
what was needful for his family.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f44" id="f44"></a><img src="images/fig44.png" width="550" height="357" alt="The Fisherman shewing the Fish to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n" title="The Fisherman shewing the Fish to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n" /></div>

<p>Such were the events that befell the fisherman: now we must relate
what happened to the maid.&mdash;She took the fish, and cleaned them, and
arranged them in the frying-pan, and left them until one side was
cooked, when she turned them upon the other side; and lo, the wall
of the kitchen clove asunder, and there came forth from it a damsel of
tall stature, smooth-cheeked, of perfect form, with eyes adorned with
ko&#7717;l,<a href="#II34" class="fnanchor">34</a> beautiful in countenance, and with heavy, swelling hips; wearing
a koofeeyeh<a href="#II35" class="fnanchor">35</a> interwoven with blue silk; with rings in her ears, and
bracelets on her wrists, and rings set with precious jewels on her
fingers; and in her hand was a rod of Indian cane: and she dipped
the end of the rod in the frying-pan, and said, O fish, are ye remaining
faithful to your covenant? At the sight of this, the cook-maid fainted.
The damsel then repeated the same words a second and a third time;
after which the fish raised their heads from the frying-pan, and
answered, Yes, yes. They then repeated the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If thou return, we return; and if thou come, we come; and if thou forsake, we verily do the same.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And upon this the damsel overturned the frying-pan, and departed by
the way she had entered, and the wall of the kitchen closed up again.
The cook-maid then arose, and beheld the four fish burnt like charcoal;
and she exclaimed, In his first encounter his staff broke!&mdash;and as she
sat reproaching herself, she beheld the Wezeer standing at her head;
and he said to her, Bring the fish to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n:&mdash;and she wept, and
informed him of what had happened.<a href="#II36" class="fnanchor">36</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f45" id="f45"></a><img src="images/fig45.png" width="550" height="608" alt="The Cook-maid dressing the Fish" title="The Cook-maid dressing the Fish" /></div>

<p>The Wezeer was astonished at her words, and exclaimed, This is
indeed a wonderful event;&mdash;and he sent for the fisherman, and when
he was brought, he said to him, O fisherman, thou must bring to us
four fish like those which thou broughtest before. The fisherman
accordingly went forth to the lake, and threw his net, and when he
had drawn it in he found in it four fish as before; and he took
them to the Wezeer, who went with them to the maid, and said to
her, Rise, and fry them in my presence, that I may witness this
occurrence. The maid, therefore, prepared the fish, and put them in
the frying-pan, and they had remained but a little while, when the
wall clove asunder, and the damsel appeared, clad as before, and
holding the rod; and she dipped the end of the rod in the frying-pan,
and said, O fish, O fish, are ye remaining faithful to your old covenant?
Upon which they raised their heads, and answered as before; and the
damsel overturned the frying-pan with the rod, and returned by the
way she had entered, and the wall closed up again.</p>

<p>The Wezeer then said, This is an event which cannot be concealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
from the King:&mdash;so he went to him, and informed him of what had
happened in his presence; and the King said, I must see this with
my own eyes. He sent, therefore, to the fisherman, and commanded
him to bring four fish like the former; granting him a delay of three
days. And the fisherman repaired to the lake, and brought the fish
thence to the King, who ordered again that four hundred pieces of
gold should be given to him; and then, turning to the Wezeer, said
to him, Cook the fish thyself here before me. The Wezeer answered,
I hear and obey. He brought the frying-pan, and, after he had
cleaned the fish, threw them into it; and as soon as he had turned
them, the wall clove asunder, and there came forth from it a negro,
in size like a bull, or like one of the tribe of '&Aacute;d,<a href="#II37" class="fnanchor">37</a> having in his
hand a branch of a green tree; and he said, with a clear but terrifying
voice, O fish, O fish, are ye remaining faithful to your old covenant?
Upon which they raised their heads, and answered as before, Yes, yes:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If thou return, we return; and if thou come, we come; and if thou forsake, we verily do the same.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The black then approached the frying-pan, and overturned it with the
branch, and the fish became like charcoal, and he went away as he
had come.</p>

<p>When he had thus disappeared from before their eyes, the King
said, This is an event respecting which it is impossible to keep silence,
and there must, undoubtedly, be some strange circumstance connected
with these fish. He then ordered that the fisherman should be brought
before him, and when he had come, he said to him, Whence came
these fish? The fisherman answered, From a lake between four mountains
behind this mountain which is without thy city. The King said
to him, How many days' journey<a href="#II38" class="fnanchor">38</a> distant? He answered, O our lord
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, a journey of half-an-hour. And the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n was astonished,
and ordered his troops to go out immediately with him and the fisherman,
who began to curse the 'Efreet. They proceeded until they had
ascended the mountain, and descended into a wide desert tract which
they had never before seen in their whole lives; and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n and
all the troops wondered at the sight of this desert, which was between
four mountains, and at the fish, which were of four colours, red and
white and yellow and blue. The King paused in astonishment, and
said to the troops, and to the other attendants who were with him,
Hath any one of you before seen this lake in this place? They all
answered, No. Then said the King, By Allah, I will not enter my
city, nor will I sit upon my throne, until I know the true history of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
this lake, and of its fish. And upon this he ordered his people to
encamp around these mountains; and they did so. He then called
for the Wezeer, who was a well-informed, sensible, prudent, and learned
man; and when he had presented himself before him, he said to him,
I desire to do a thing with which I will acquaint thee; and it is this:&mdash;I
have resolved to depart alone this night, to seek for information
respecting this lake and its fish: therefore, sit thou at the door of my
pavilion, and say to the Emeers and Wezeers and Chamberlains, The
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n is sick, and hath commanded me not to allow any person to go
in unto him:&mdash;and acquaint no one with my intention.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f46" id="f46"></a><img src="images/fig46.png" width="550" height="245" alt="The Black Palace" title="The Black Palace" /></div>

<p>The Wezeer was unable to oppose his design; so the King disguised
himself, and slung on his sword, and withdrew himself from the midst
of his troops. He journeyed the whole of the night, until the morning,
and proceeded until the heat became oppressive to him: he then
paused to rest; after which he again proceeded the remainder of the
day and the second night until the morning, when there appeared
before him, in the distance, something black, at the sight of which he
rejoiced, and said, Perhaps I shall there find some person who will
inform me of the history of the lake and its fish. And when he
approached this black object, he found it to be a palace built of black
stones, and overlaid with iron; and one of the leaves of its doors was
open, and the other shut. The King was glad, and he stood at the
door, and knocked gently, but heard no answer; he knocked a second
and a third time, but again heard no answer: then he knocked a fourth
time, and with violence; but no one answered. So he said, It is
doubtless empty:&mdash;and he took courage, and entered from the door
into the passage, and cried out, saying, O inhabitants of the palace,
I am a stranger and a traveller! have ye any provision? And he
repeated these words a second and a third time; but heard no answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
And upon this he fortified his heart, and emboldened himself, and
proceeded from the passage into the midst of the palace; but he found
no one there, and only saw that it was furnished, and that there was,
in the centre of it, a fountain with four lions of red gold, which poured
forth the water from their mouths, like pearls and jewels: around
this were birds; and over the top of the palace was extended a net
which prevented their flying out. At the sight of these objects he was
astonished, and he was grieved that he saw no person there whom he
could ask for information respecting the lake, and the fish, and the
mountains, and the palace. He then sat down between the doors,<a href="#II39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
reflecting upon these things; and as he thus sat, he heard a voice of
lamentation from a sorrowful heart, chanting these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O fortune, thou pitiest me not, nor releasest me! See my heart is straitened between affliction and peril!</span>
<span class="i0">Will not you [O my wife] have compassion on the mighty whom love hath abased, and the wealthy who is reduced to indigence?</span>
<span class="i0">We were jealous even of the zephyr which passed over you: but when the divine decree is issued, the eye becometh blind!</span>
<span class="i0">What resource hath the archer when, in the hour of conflict, he desireth to discharge the arrow, but findeth his bow-string broken.</span>
<span class="i0">And when troubles are multiplied upon the noble-minded, where shall he find refuge from fate and from destiny?<a href="#II40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n heard this lamentation, he sprang upon his feet,
and, seeking the direction whence it proceeded, found a curtain suspended
before the door of a chamber; and he raised it, and beheld
behind it a young man sitting on a couch raised to the height of a cubit
from the floor. He was a handsome youth, well-shaped, and of eloquent
speech, with shining forehead, and rosy cheek, marked with a mole
resembling ambergris. The King was rejoiced at seeing him, and
saluted him; and the young man (who remained sitting, and was clad
with a vest of silk, embroidered with gold, but who exhibited traces of
grief) returned his salutation, and said to him, O my master, excuse
my not rising.&mdash;O youth! said the King, inform me respecting the
lake, and its fish of various colours, and respecting this palace, and the
reason of thy being alone in it, and of thy lamentation. When the
young man heard these words, tears trickled down his cheeks, and he
wept bitterly.<a href="#II41" class="fnanchor">41</a> And the King was astonished, and said to him, What
causeth thee to weep, O youth? He answered, How can I refrain
from weeping, when this is my state?&mdash;and so saying, he stretched
forth his hand, and lifted up the skirts of his clothing; and lo, half
of him, from his waist to the soles of his feet, was stone; and from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
his waist to the hair of his head, he was like other men. He then
said, Know, O King, that the story of the fish is extraordinary; if it
were engraved upon the intellect, it would be a lesson to him who
would be admonished:&mdash;and he related as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f47" id="f47"></a><img src="images/fig47.png" width="550" height="532" alt="The Sult&aacute;n discovering the Young King of the Black Islands" title="The Sult&aacute;n discovering the Young King of the Black Islands" /></div>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE YOUNG KING OF THE BLACK ISLANDS.</h5>

<p>My father was king of the city which was here situate: his
name was Ma&#7717;mood, and he was lord of the Black Islands, and of the
four mountains. After a reign of seventy years, he died, and I succeeded
to his throne; whereupon I took as my wife the daughter of
my uncle; and she loved me excessively, so that when I absented
myself from her, she would neither eat nor drink till she saw me
again. She remained under my protection five years. After this, she
went one day to the bath; and I had commanded the cook to prepare
the supper, and entered this palace, and slept in my usual place.<a href="#II42" class="fnanchor">42</a> I
had ordered two maids to fan me;<a href="#II43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and one of them sat at my head,
and the other at my feet; but I was restless, because my wife was not
with me; and I could not sleep. My eyes were closed, but my spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
was awake; and I heard the maid at my head say to her at my feet,
O Mes'oodeh,<a href="#II44" class="fnanchor">44</a> verily our lord is unfortunate in his youth, and what
a pity is it that it should be passed with our depraved, wicked
mistress!&mdash;Perdition to unfaithful wives! replied the other: but
(added she) such a person as our lord, so endowed by nature, is not
suited to this profligate woman, who passes every night absent from
his bed.&mdash;Verily, rejoined she at my head, our lord is careless in not
making any inquiry respecting her.&mdash;Wo to thee! said the other:
hath our lord any knowledge of her conduct, or doth she leave him to
his choice? Nay, on the contrary, she contriveth to defraud him by
means of the cup of wine<a href="#II45" class="fnanchor">45</a> which he drinketh every night before he
sleepeth, putting benj<a href="#II46" class="fnanchor">46</a> into it; in consequence of which he sleepeth
so soundly that he knoweth not what happeneth, nor whither she
goeth, nor what she doeth; for, after she hath given him the wine to
drink, she dresseth herself, and goeth out from him, and is absent
until daybreak, when she returneth to him, and burneth a perfume
under his nose, upon which he awaketh from his sleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f48" id="f48"></a><img src="images/fig48.png" width="550" height="475" alt="The Young King on his Bed, attended by Two Maids" title="The Young King on his Bed, attended by Two Maids" /></div>

<p>When I heard this conversation of the maids, the light became
darkness before my face, and I was hardly conscious of the approach
of night, when my cousin returned from the bath. The table was
prepared, and we ate, and sat a while drinking our wine as usual. I
then called for the wine which I was accustomed to drink before I lay
down to sleep, and she handed to me the cup; but I turned away, and,
pretending to drink it as I was wont to do, poured it into my bosom,
and immediately lay down: upon which she said, Sleep on; I wish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
that thou wouldst never wake again! By Allah, I abhor thee, and
abhor thy person, and my soul is weary of thy company!&mdash;She
then arose, and attired herself in the most magnificent of her apparel,
and, having perfumed herself, and slung on a sword, opened the door
of the palace, and went out. I got up immediately, and followed her
until she had quitted the palace, and passed through the streets of the
city, and arrived at the city-gates, when she pronounced some words
that I understood not; whereupon the locks fell off, and the gates
opened, and she went out, I still following her, without her knowledge.
Thence she proceeded to a space among the mounds,<a href="#II47" class="fnanchor">47</a> and arrived at
a strong edifice, in which was a &#7731;ubbeh<a href="#II48" class="fnanchor">48</a> constructed of mud, with a
door, which she entered. I then climbed upon the roof of the &#7731;ubbeh,
and, looking down upon her through an aperture, saw that she was
visiting a black slave, whose large lips, one of which overlapped the
other, gathered up the sand from the pebbly floor, while he lay, in a
filthy and wet condition, upon a few stalks of sugar-cane.</p>

<p>She kissed the ground before this slave; and he raised his head
towards her, and said, Wo to thee! Wherefore hast thou remained
away until this hour? The other blacks have been here drinking wine,
and each of them has gone away with his mistress; and I refused to
drink on thy account.&mdash;She answered, O my master, and beloved of
my heart, knowest thou not that I am married to my cousin, and that
I abhor every man who resembles him, and hate myself while I am in
his company? If I did not fear to displease thee, I would reduce the
city to ruins, so that the owl and the raven should cry in it, and would
transport its stones beyond Mount &#7730;&aacute;f.<a href="#II49" class="fnanchor">49</a>&mdash;Thou liest, thou infamous
woman, replied the slave; and I swear by the generosity of the blacks
(and if I speak not truth, may our valour be as the valour of the
whites), that if thou loiter as thou hast now done till this hour, I
will no longer give thee my company, nor approach thy person, thou
faithless one! Dost thou inconvenience me for the sake of thine own
pleasure,  thou filthy wretch, and vilest of the whites?&mdash;When I heard
(continued the King) their words, and witnessed what passed between
them, the world became dark before my face, and I knew not where I
was.&mdash;My cousin still stood weeping, and abasing herself before him,
and said, O my beloved, and treasure of my heart, there remaineth to
me none but thee for whom I care, and if thou cast me off, alas for
me! O my beloved! O light of mine eye!&mdash;Thus she continued to
weep, and to humble herself before him, until he became pacified
towards her; upon which she rejoiced, and arose, and, having dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>robed
herself, said to him, O my master, hast thou here anything that
thy maid may eat? He answered, Uncover the dough-pan; it contains
some cooked rats' bones:<a href="#II50" class="fnanchor">50</a> eat of them, and pick them; and take this
earthen pot: thou wilt find in it some boo&#7827;ah<a href="#II51" class="fnanchor">51</a> to drink. So she arose,
and ate and drank, and washed her hands; after which she lay down
by the side of the slave, upon the stalks of sugar-cane, and covered
herself with his tattered clothes and rags.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f49" id="f49"></a><img src="images/fig49.png" width="550" height="603" alt="The Black Slave wounded by the Young King" title="The Black Slave wounded by the Young King" /></div>

<p>When I saw her do this, I became unconscious of my existence,
and, descending from the roof of the &#7731;ubbeh, entered, and took the
sword from the side of my cousin, with the intention of killing them
both. I struck the slave upon his neck, and thought that he was
killed; but the blow, which I gave with the view of severing his head,
only cut the gullet and skin and flesh; and when I thought that I had
killed him, he uttered a loud snore, upon which my cousin started up,
and as soon as I had gone, took the sword, and returned it to its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
scabbard, and came back to the city and to the palace, and lay down
again in my bed, in which she remained until the morning.</p>

<p>On the following day, I observed that my cousin had cut off her
hair, and put on the apparel of mourning;<a href="#II52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and she said to me, O
my cousin, blame me not for what I do; for I have received news that
my mother is dead, and that my father hath been slain in a holy war,
and that one of my two brothers hath died of a poisonous sting, and
the other by the fall of a house: it is natural, therefore, that I should
weep and mourn. On hearing these words, I abstained from upbraiding
her, and said, Do what seemeth fit to thee; for I will not oppose thee.
Accordingly, she continued mourning and weeping and wailing a whole
year; after which she said to me, I have a desire to build for myself,
in thy palace, a tomb, with a &#7731;ubbeh, that I may repair thither alone
to mourn, and I will call it the House of Lamentations.<a href="#II53" class="fnanchor">53</a> I replied,
Do what thou seest fit. So she built for herself a house for mourning,
with a &#7731;ubbeh in the middle of it, like the tomb of a saint;<a href="#II54" class="fnanchor">54</a> after
which she removed thither the slave, and there she lodged him. He
was in a state of excessive weakness, and unable to render her any
service, though he drank wine; and from the day on which I had
wounded him, he had never spoken; yet he remained alive, because
the appointed term of his life had not expired. My cousin every day
visited him in this tomb early and late, to weep and mourn over him,
and took to him wine to drink, and boiled meats; and thus she continued
to do, morning and evening, until the expiration of the second
year, while I patiently suffered her, till one day, I entered her apartment
unawares, and found her weeping, and slapping her face, and
repeating these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have lost my existence among mankind since your absence; for my heart loveth none but you.</span>
<span class="i0">Take my body, then, in mercy, to the place where you are laid; and there bury me by your side:</span>
<span class="i0">And if, at my grave, you utter my name, the moaning of my bones shall answer to your call.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As soon as she had finished the recitation of these verses, I said to
her, holding my drawn sword in my hand, This is the language of
those faithless women who renounce the ties of affinity, and regard not
lawful fellowship!&mdash;and I was about to strike her with the sword, and
had lifted up my arm to do so, when she rose&mdash;for she knew that it
was I who had wounded the slave&mdash;and, standing before me, pronounced
some words which I understood not, and said, May God, by
means of my enchantment, make thee to be half of stone, and half of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the substance of man!&mdash;whereupon I became as thou seest, unable to
move, neither dead nor alive; and when I had been reduced to this
state, she enchanted the city and its markets and fields. The inhabitants
of our city were of four classes; Muslims, and Christians, and
Jews, and Magians; and she transformed them into fish: the white
are the Muslims; the red, the Magians; the blue, the Christians; and
the yellow, the Jews.<a href="#II55" class="fnanchor">55</a> She transformed, also, the four islands into
four mountains, and placed them around the lake; and from that time
she has continued every day to torture me, inflicting upon me a
hundred lashes with a leathern whip, until the blood flows from my
wounds; after which she puts on my upper half a vest of hair-cloth,
beneath these garments.&mdash;Having said thus, the young man wept, and
ejaculating the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Give me patience, O Allah, to bear what Thou decreest! I will be patient, if so I may obtain thine approval.</span>
<span class="i0">I am straitened, indeed, by the calamity that hath befallen me: but the Family of the favoured Prophet shall intercede for me!<a href="#II56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon this, the King, looking towards the young man, said to him,
O youth, thou hast increased my anxiety. And where (he added) is
this woman?&mdash;The young man answered, She is in the tomb where
the slave is lying, in the &#7731;ubbeh; and every day, before she visits
him, she strips me of my clothing, and inflicts upon me a hundred
lashes with the whip, while I weep and cry out, unable to move so as
to repulse her. After thus torturing me, she repairs early to the slave,
with the wine and boiled meat.&mdash;By Allah, O youth, said the King, I
will do thee an act of kindness for which I shall be remembered, and a
favour which historians shall record in a biography after me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f50" id="f50"></a><img src="images/fig50.png" width="550" height="231" alt="The Kubbeh, or Tomb" title="The Kubbeh, or Tomb" /></div>

<p>He then sat and conversed with him until the approach of night,
upon which he arose, and waited till the first dawn of day, when he
took off his clothes, and slung on his sword, and went to the place
where the slave lay. After remarking the candles and lamps, and
perfumes and ointments, he approached the slave, and with a blow of
his sword slew him: he then carried him on his back, and threw him
into a well which he found in the palace, and, returning to the &#7731;ubbeh,
clad himself with the slave's clothes, and lay down with the drawn
sword by his side. Soon after, the vile enchantress went to her cousin,
and, having pulled off his clothes, took the whip, and beat him, while
he cried, Ah! it is enough for me to be in this state! Have pity on
me then!&mdash;Didst thou shew pity to me, she exclaimed, and didst thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
spare my lover?&mdash;She then put on him the hair-cloth vest and his
outer garments, and repaired to the slave with a cup of wine, and a
bowl of boiled meat. Entering the tomb, she wept and wailed, exclaiming,
O my master, answer me! O my master, speak to me!&mdash;and
poured forth her lamentation in the words of this verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How long shall this aversion and harshness continue? Sufficient is the evil which my passion hath brought upon me!<a href="#II57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, weeping as before, she exclaimed again, O my master, answer
me, and speak to me! Upon this the King, speaking in a low voice,
and adapting his tongue to the pronunciation of the blacks, ejaculated,
Ah! Ah! there is no strength nor power but in God! On hearing
these words, she screamed with joy, and fell down in a swoon; and
when she recovered, she exclaimed, Possibly my master is restored to
health! The King, again lowering his voice, as if from weakness,
replied, Thou profligate wretch, thou deservest not that I should
address thee.&mdash;Wherefore? said she. He answered, Because all the
day long thou tormentest thy husband, while he calleth out, and
imploreth the aid of God, so that thou hast prevented my sleeping
from the commencement of darkness until morning: thy husband hath
not ceased to humble himself, and to imprecate vengeance upon thee,
till he hath distracted me; and had it not been for this, I had recovered
my strength: this it is which hath prevented my answering thee.&mdash;Then,
with thy permission, she replied, I will liberate him from his
present sufferings.&mdash;Liberate him, said the King, and give us ease.</p>

<p>She replied, I hear and obey;&mdash;and immediately arose, and went
out from the &#7731;ubbeh to the palace, and, taking a cup, filled it with
water, and pronounced certain words over it, upon which it began to
boil like a cauldron. She then sprinkled some of it upon her cousin,
saying, By virtue of what I have uttered, be changed from thy present
state to that in which thou wast at first!&mdash;and instantly he shook, and
stood upon his feet, rejoicing in his liberation, and exclaimed, I testify<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
that there is no deity but God, and that Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle;
God bless and save him! She then said to him, Depart, and return
not hither, or I will kill thee:&mdash;and she cried out in his face: so he
departed from before her, and she returned to the &#7731;ubbeh, and said,
O my master, come forth to me that I may behold thee. He replied,
with a weak voice, What hast thou done? Thou hast relieved me
from the branch, but hast not relieved me from the root.&mdash;O my
beloved, she said, and what is the root? He answered, The people
of this city, and of the four islands: every night, at the middle hour,
the fish raise their heads, and imprecate vengeance upon me and upon
thee; and this is the cause that preventeth the return of vigour to my
body; therefore, liberate them, and come, and take my hand, and
raise me; for vigour hath already in part returned to me.</p>

<p>On hearing these words of the King, whom she imagined to be
the slave, she said to him with joy, O my master, on my head and
my eye! In the name of Allah!<a href="#II58" class="fnanchor">58</a>&mdash;and she sprang up, full of happiness,
and hastened to the lake, where, taking a little of its water,
she pronounced over it some unintelligible words, whereupon the fish
became agitated, and raised their heads, and immediately became converted
into men as before. Thus was the enchantment removed from
the inhabitants of the city, and the city became repeopled, and the
market-streets re-erected, and every one returned to his occupation:
the mountains also became changed into islands as they were at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
first. The enchantress then returned immediately to the King, whom
she still imagined to be the slave, and said to him, O my beloved,
stretch forth thy honoured hand, that I may kiss it.&mdash;Approach me,
said the King in a low voice. So she drew near to him; and he,
having his keen-edged sword ready in his hand, thrust it into her
bosom, and the point protruded from her back: he then struck her
again, and clove her in twain, and went forth.</p>

<p>He found the young man who had been enchanted waiting his
return, and congratulated him on his safety; and the young prince
kissed his hand, and thanked him. The King then said to him, Wilt
thou remain in thy city, or come with me to my capital?&mdash;O King of
the age, said the young man, dost thou know the distance that is
between thee and thy city? The King answered, Two days and a
half.&mdash;O King, replied the young man, if thou hast been asleep,
awake: between thee and thy city is a distance of a year's journey to
him who travelleth with diligence; and thou camest in two days and
a half only because the city was enchanted: but, O King, I will never
quit thee for the twinkling of an eye. The King rejoiced at his
words, and said, Praise be to God, who hath in his beneficence given
thee to me: thou art my son; for during my whole life, I have never
been blest with a son:&mdash;and they embraced each other, and rejoiced
exceedingly. They then went together into the palace, where the
King who had been enchanted informed the officers of his court that
he was about to perform the holy pilgrimage: so they prepared for
him everything that he required; and he departed with the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n;
his heart burning with reflections upon his city, because he had been
deprived of the sight of it for the space of a year.</p>

<p>He set forth, accompanied by fifty memlooks,<a href="#II59" class="fnanchor">59</a> and provided with
presents, and they continued their journey night and day for a whole
year, after which they drew near to the city of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and the
Wezeer and the troops, who had lost all hope of his return, came forth
to meet him. The troops, approaching him, kissed the ground before
him, and congratulated him on his safe return; and he entered the
city, and sat upon the throne. He then acquainted the Wezeer with
all that had happened to the young King; on hearing which, the Wezeer
congratulated the latter, also, on his safety; and when all things were
restored to order, the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n bestowed presents upon a number of his
subjects, and said to the Wezeer, Bring to me the fisherman who presented
to me the fish. So he sent to this fisherman, who had been
the cause of the restoration of the inhabitants of the enchanted city,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and brought him; and the King invested him with a dress of honour,
and inquired of him respecting his circumstances, and whether he had
any children. The fisherman informed him that he had a son and two
daughters; and the King, on hearing this, took as his wife one of the
daughters, and the young prince married the other.<a href="#II60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The King also
conferred upon the son the office of treasurer. He then sent the
Wezeer to the city of the young prince, the capital of the Black
Islands, and invested him with its sovereignty, despatching with him
the fifty memlooks who had accompanied him thence, with numerous
robes of honour to all the Emeers: and the Wezeer kissed his hands,
and set forth on his journey; while the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n and the young prince
remained. And as to the fisherman, he became the wealthiest of the
people of his age; and his daughters continued to be the wives of the
Kings until they died.</p>

<p>But this (added Shahraz&aacute;d) is not more wonderful than what
happened to the porter.</p>

<h5>NOTES TO CHAPTER SECOND.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II1" id="II1">1.</a></span> The sentiment expressed in this verse is one which is often heard from
the mouth of a Muslim; but generally when, his toil is ended, and its result seen; though
not unfrequently as an excuse for indolence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II2" id="II2">2.</a></span> The bottle is here described (by the term "&#7731;um&#7731;um") as of a kind commonly
used for sprinkling rose-water, &amp;c., having a spherical or wide body, with a long
and narrow neck. I remember seeing a gilt brass bottle of this kind, of very beautiful
workmanship, for which nearly as much as ten pieces of gold was demanded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II3" id="II3">3.</a></span> The seal of Suleym&aacute;n, or Solomon, has twice been mentioned in former
notes; in No. 21 of the notes appended to the Introduction, and in No. 15 of those to
the first chapter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II4" id="II4">4.</a></span> It is necessary to remark, that this and many other descriptions in the
present work are not designed to be understood in their literal sense. The reader will
often be required to make some allowance for Oriental hyperbole, and to distinguish
between expressions characterised by this figure, and such as are purely accordant with
Eastern grandeur and magnificence, or with Muslim superstition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II5" id="II5">5.</a></span> The end of the winnowing-fork bears a rude resemblance to a gigantic
hand; having several long prongs of wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II6" id="II6">6.</a></span> Instead of "ibree&#7731;" (a ewer), in the Cairo edition, I read "abw&aacute;&#7731;"
(trumpets), as in other editions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II7" id="II7">7.</a></span> This appellation has been mentioned in a former note, as signifying an
evil Jinnee of the most powerful class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II8" id="II8">8.</a></span> It is a rule observed in decent society, by the Arabs, to avoid, as much as
possible, the mention of opprobrious epithets, lest any person present should imagine
such epithets to be addressed insidiously to himself. For this reason, when any malediction
or offensive language is repeated in a story, it is usual with them to designate
the object of such language by this term, which signifies both remote or absent from
the person or persons in whose presence the words are repeated, and remote from virtue
or good. In the present instance, "remote" is an epithet substituted by Shahraz&aacute;d
for some other of a gross nature, from respect to the king to whom she is relating the
story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II9" id="II9">9.</a></span> I read "&#7778;akhr el-Jinnee" for "&#7778;akhr el-Jinn."&mdash;&#7778;akhr was an evil
Jinnee, and a terrible enemy of Solomon. His last act of treachery to that monarch, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
his fate, are thus related by commentators on the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n.&mdash;Solomon having, through
negligence, suffered one of his women to practise idolatry under his roof, God saw fit to
punish him. It was the custom of this King, on certain occasions, "to intrust his
signet, on which his kingdom depended, with a concubine of his, named El-Emeeneh.
One day, therefore, when she had the ring in her custody, a devil [or evil Jinnee],
named &#7778;akhr, came to her in the shape of Solomon, and received the ring from her; by
virtue of which he became possessed of the kingdom, and sat on the throne in the shape
which he had borrowed, making what alterations in the law he pleased. Solomon, in
the meantime, being changed in his outward appearance, and known to none of his
subjects, was obliged to wander about, and beg alms for his subsistence; till at length,
after the space of forty days, which was the time the image had been worshipped in his
house, the devil flew away, and threw the signet into the sea. The signet was immediately
swallowed by a fish, which being taken and given to Solomon, he found the
ring in its belly; and having by this means recovered the kingdom, he took &#7778;akhr, and,
tying a great stone to his neck, threw him into the Lake of Tiberias."<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II10" id="II10">10.</a></span> "Umm-'&Aacute;mir" is an appellation of the hyena. It is scarcely necessary
to mention, that the proverb here quoted is said to have originated from the fact of a
man's having been devoured by a hyena whom he had aided against an enemy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II11" id="II11">11.</a></span> In some copies, the personage here mentioned is called "Melik el-Yoon&aacute;n,"
that is, "King of Ancient Greece," or&mdash;"of the Ancient Greeks." I have
followed the Cairo edition, and that of the first two hundred nights, printed at Calcutta,
in which "Yoon&aacute;n" is used as the King's proper name. See also Note 13.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II12" id="II12">12.</a></span> This is the name of the sage in most copies; but in the Cairo edition he
is called "Rooy&aacute;n."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II13" id="II13">13.</a></span> In the Calcutta edition, the king is merely said to have reigned "in the
country of the Persians," as in my translation; but in the Cairo edition, he is said to
have been "in the <i>city</i> of the Persians, and the country of Room&aacute;n;" which may
perhaps mean (though this is hardly allowable) the [eastern] Roman, or later Greek,
empire; an unnecessary contradiction. (See Note 22 to Chapter x.) It is obviously
more agreeable with the story to regard him as a Persian King.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II14" id="II14">14.</a></span> "The Ornament of the Good," or&mdash;"of the Comely," is an appellation
of the Arabian prophet, who is related to have said, "The sun never riseth until it hath
saluted me." "The sun's saluting the Ornament of the Good," or "Comely," is, therefore,
a phrase not unfrequently used by Muslims merely to signify its rising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II15" id="II15">15.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Rewards of Men of Literature and Science.</i> It has long been
a common custom of Eastern princes to bestow dresses of honour upon men of literature
and science, as well as upon their great officers and other servants. These dresses were
of different kinds for persons of different classes or professions. The most usual kind
was an ample coat. With dresses of this description were often given gold-embroidered
turbans; and sometimes, to Emeers (or great military officers), neck-rings or collars
(called &#7789;&oacute;&#7731;s), some of which were set with jewels; as also, bracelets, and swords ornamented
with precious stones, &amp;c.; and to Wezeers, instead of the &#7789;&oacute;&#7731;, a necklace of
jewels.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>&mdash;The following striking record will convey an idea of the magnificence of some
of these dresses of honour; or, in other words, of the liberality of a Muslim prince, and,
at the same time, of the very precarious nature of his favour. A person, chancing to
look at a register kept by one of the officers of H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed, saw in it the
following entry:&mdash;"Four hundred thousand pieces of gold, the price of a dress of
honour for Ja&#7841;far, the son of Ya&#7717;y&agrave;, the Wezeer."&mdash;A few days after, he saw beneath
this written,&mdash;"Ten &#7731;eer&aacute;&#7789;s, the price of naphtha and reeds, for burning the body of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>Ja&#7841;far, the son of Ya&#7717;y&agrave;."<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>&mdash;The &#7731;eer&aacute;&#7789; of Baghd&aacute;d was the twentieth part of a deen&aacute;r,
or piece of gold.</p>

<p>Arab princes and other great men have generally been famous for highly respecting,
and liberally rewarding, men of literature and science, and especially poets. El-Mamoon
and many others are well known to us for their patronage of the learned.
Er-Rasheed carried his condescension to them so far as to pour the water on the hands
of a blind man, Aboo-Mo'&aacute;wiyeh, one of the most learned persons of his time, previously
to his eating with him, to shew his respect for science.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> An anecdote of a Khaleefeh
ordering the mouth of a learned man to be filled with jewels, I have related in a former
note. To cram the mouth with sugar or sweetmeats for a polite or eloquent speech, or
piece of poetry, has been more commonly done; but the usual presents to learned men
were, and are, dresses of honour and sums of money. Ibn-'Obeyd El-Bakhteree, an
illustrious poet and traditionist, who flourished in the reign of El-Musta'een, is said to
have received so many presents, that, after his death, there were found, among the
property which he left, a hundred complete suits of dress, two hundred shirts, and five
hundred turbans.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> A thousand pieces of gold were often given, and sometimes ten,
twenty, or thirty, thousand, and even more, for a few verses; nay, for a single couplet.</p>

<p>The prodigality of Arab princes to men of learning may be exemplified by the
following anecdote:&mdash;&#7716;amm&aacute;d, surnamed Er-R&aacute;wiyeh, or the famous reciter, having
attached himself to the Khaleefeh El-Weleed, the son of 'Abd-el-Melik, and shewn a
contrary feeling towards his brother Hish&aacute;m, on the accession of the latter fled to
El-Koofeh. While there, a letter arrived from Hish&aacute;m, commanding his presence at
Damascus: it was addressed to the governor, who, being ordered to treat him with
honour, gave him a purse containing a thousand pieces of gold, and despatched him
with the Khaleefeh's messenger. On his arrival at Damascus, he was conducted before
Hish&aacute;m, whom he found in a splendid saloon, seated under a pavilion of red silk, surmounted
by a dome of yellow brocade, attended by two female slaves of beauty unsurpassed,
each holding a crystal ewer of wine. His admission during the presence of
members of the King's &#7717;areem, the reader will remark as a very unusual and high
honour: the mention of the wine may also surprise him; but this is a subject upon
which much may be said, and which will be considered on a future occasion. After
&#7716;amm&aacute;d had given the salutation, and the Khaleefeh had returned it, the latter told
him that he had sent for him to ask respecting a couplet of which he (the Khaleefeh)
could only remember that it ended with the word "ibree&#7731;," which signifies "a ewer."
The reciter reflected a while, and the lines occurred to his mind, and he repeated them.
Hish&aacute;m cried out, in delight, that the lines were those he meant; drank a cup of wine,
and desired one of the female slaves to hand a cup to &#7716;amm&aacute;d. She did so; and the
draught, he says, deprived him of one-third of his reason. The Khaleefeh desired him
to repeat the lines again, and drank a second cup; and &#7716;amm&aacute;d was deprived of
another third of his reason in the same manner; and said, "O Prince of the Faithful,
two-thirds of my reason have departed from me." Hish&aacute;m laughed, and desired him to
ask what he would before the remaining third should have gone; and the reciter said,
"One of these two female slaves." The Khaleefeh laughed again, and said, "Nay,
but both of them are thine, and all that is upon them, and all that they possess, and,
beside them, fifty thousand pieces of gold."&mdash;"I kissed the ground before him," says
&#7716;amm&aacute;d, "and drank a third cup, and was unconscious of what happened after: I did
not awake till the close of the night, when I found myself in a handsome house, surrounded
by lighted candles, and the two female slaves were putting in order my clothes
and other things: so I took possession of the property, and departed, the happiest of
the creatures of God."<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>
<p>A whimsical story is told of a king, who denied to poets those rewards to which
usage had almost given them a claim. This king, whose name is not recorded, had the
faculty of retaining in his memory an ode after having only once heard it; and he had
a memlook who could repeat an ode that he had twice heard, and a female slave who
could repeat one that she had heard thrice. Whenever a poet came to compliment him
with a panegyrical ode, the King used to promise him that, if he found his verses to be
his original composition, he would give him a sum of money equal in weight to what
they were written upon. The poet, consenting, would recite his ode; and the King
would say, "It is not new; for I have known it some years;" and would repeat it as he
had heard it; after which he would add, "And this memlook also retains it in his
memory;" and would order the memlook to repeat it; which, having heard it twice,
from the poet and the king, he would do. The King would then say to the poet, "I
have also a female slave who can repeat it;" and on his ordering her to do so, stationed
behind the curtains, she would repeat what she had thus thrice heard: so the poet
would go away empty-handed. The famous poet El-A&#7779;ma'ee, having heard of this
proceeding, and guessing the trick, determined upon outwitting the King; and accordingly
composed an ode made up of very difficult words; but this was not his only
preparative measure; another will be presently explained; and a third was, to assume
the dress of a Bedawee, that he might not be known, covering his face, the eyes only
excepted, with a lith&aacute;m (a piece of drapery) in accordance with a custom of Arabs of
the desert. Thus disguised, he went to the palace, and, having asked permission,
entered, and saluted the King, who said to him, "Whence art thou, O brother of the
Arabs, and what dost thou desire?" The poet answered, "May God increase the power
of the King! I am a poet of such a tribe, and have composed an ode in praise of our
lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n."&mdash;"O brother of the Arabs," said the King, "hast thou heard of our
condition?"&mdash;"No," answered the poet; "and what is it, O King of the age?"&mdash;"It
is," replied the King, "that if the ode be not thine, we give thee no reward; and if it
be thine, we give thee the weight in money of what it is written upon."&mdash;"How," said
El-A&#7779;ma'ee, "should I assume to myself that which belongs to another, and knowing,
too, that lying before kings is one of the basest of actions? But I agree to this
condition, O our lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n." So he repeated his ode. The King, perplexed, and
unable to remember any of it, made a sign to the memlook&mdash;but he had retained
nothing; and called to the female slave, but she also was unable to repeat a word. "O
brother of the Arabs," said he, "thou hast spoken truth, and the ode is thine without
doubt: I have never heard it before: produce, therefore, what it is written upon, and
we will give thee its weight in money, as we have promised."&mdash;"Wilt thou," said the
poet, "send one of the attendants to carry it?"&mdash;"To carry what?" asked the King;
"is it not upon a paper here in thy possession?"&mdash;"No, O our lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n," replied
the poet; "at the time I composed it I could not procure a piece of paper upon which
to write it, and could find nothing but a fragment of a marble column left me by my
father; so I engraved it upon this; and it lies in the court of the palace." He had
brought it, wrapped up, on the back of a camel. The King, to fulfil his promise, was
obliged to exhaust his treasury; and to prevent a repetition of this trick (of which he
afterwards discovered El-A&#7779;ma'ee to have been the author), in future rewarded the
poets according to the usual custom of kings.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>The following case is also related as an exception to the common custom of great
men, with regard to the bestowal of rewards on poets:&mdash;"A poet praised a governor in
some verses, and the latter ordered an ass's barda'ah (or stuffed saddle) and girth to be
given to him. The poet went away with them on his shoulder; and, being asked what
he had got, answered, 'I have praised our honoured lord in the best of my verses, and
he hath bestowed on me some of the most magnificent articles of his apparel.'"<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II16" id="II16">16.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Bath.</i> The &#7717;amm&aacute;m, or bath, is a favourite resort of both men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>and women of all classes among the Muslims who can afford the trifling expense which
it requires; and (it is said) not only of human beings, but also of evil genii; on which
account, as well as on that of decency, several precepts respecting it have been dictated
by Mo&#7717;ammad. It is frequented for the purpose of performing certain ablutions
required by the religion, or by a regard for cleanliness, and for its salutary effects, and
for mere luxury.</p>

<p>The following description of a public bath will convey a sufficient notion of those in
private houses, which are on a smaller scale, and generally consist of only two or three
chambers. The public bath comprises several apartments, with mosaic or tesselated
pavements, composed of white and black marble, and pieces of fine red tile, and sometimes
other materials. The inner apartments are covered with domes, having a number
of small, round, glazed apertures, for the admission of light. The first apartment is the
meslakh, or disrobing room, which has, in the centre, a fountain of cold water, and,
next the walls, wide benches or platforms, encased with marble. These are furnished
with mattresses and cushions for the higher and middle classes, and with mats for the
poorer sort. The inner division of the building, in the more regularly planned baths,
occupies nearly a square: the central and chief portion of it is the principal apartment,
or &#7717;ar&aacute;rah, which generally has the form of a cross. In its centre is a fountain of hot
water, rising from a base encased with marble, which serves as a seat. One of the
angles of the square is occupied by the beyt-owwal, or antechamber of the &#7717;ar&aacute;rah: in
another, is the fire over which is the boiler; and each of the other two angles is
generally occupied by two small chambers: in one of these is a tank filled with warm
water, which pours down from a spout in the dome: in the other are two taps, side by
side; one of hot, and the other of cold water, with a small trough beneath, before which
is a seat. The inner apartments are heated by the steam which rises from the fountain
and tanks, and by the contiguity of the fire; but the beyt-owwal is not so hot as the
&#7717;ar&aacute;rah, being separated from it by a door. In cold weather, the bather undresses in
the former, which has two or three raised seats, like those of the meslakh.</p>

<p>With a pair of wooden clogs to his feet, and having a large napkin round his loins,
and generally a second wound round his head like a turban, a third over his chest, and
a fourth covering his back, he enters the &#7717;ar&aacute;rah, the heat of which causes him
immediately to perspire profusely. An attendant of the bath removes from him all
the napkins excepting the first; and proceeds to crack the joints of his fingers and
toes, &amp;c., and several of the vertebr&aelig; of the back and neck; kneads his flesh; and rubs
the soles of his feet with a coarse earthen rasp, and his limbs and body with a woollen
bag which covers his hand as a glove; after which, the bather, if he please, plunges into
one of the tanks. He is then thoroughly washed with soap and water, and fibres of the
palm-tree, and shaved, if he wish it, in one of the small chambers which contain the taps
of hot and cold water; and returns to the beyt-owwal. Here he generally reclines upon
a mattress, and takes some light refreshment, while one of the attendants rubs the soles
of his feet, and kneads the flesh of his body and limbs, previously to his resuming his
dress. It is a common custom, now, to take a pipe and a cup of coffee during this
period of rest.</p>

<p>The women are especially fond of the bath, and often have entertainments there;
taking with them fruits, sweetmeats, &amp;c., and sometimes hiring female singers to
accompany them. An hour or more is occupied by the process of plaiting the hair, and
applying the depilatory, &amp;c.; and, generally, an equal time is passed in the enjoyment
of rest, or recreation, or refreshment. All necessary decorum is observed on these
occasions by most females; but women of the lower orders are often seen in the bath
without any covering. Some baths are appropriated solely to men; others, only to
women; and others, again, to men during the forenoon, and in the afternoon to women.
When the bath is appropriated to women, a napkin, or some other piece of drapery, is
suspended over the door, to warn men from entering.</p>

<p>Before the time of Mo&#7717;ammad, there were no public baths in Arabia; and he was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
prejudiced against them, for the reasons already alluded to, that he at first forbade both
men and women from entering them: afterwards, however, he permitted men to do so,
if for the sake of cleanliness, on the condition of their having a cloth round the waist;
and women also on account of sickness, child-birth, &amp;c., provided they had not convenient
places for bathing in their houses. But, notwithstanding this license, it is held
to be a characteristic of a virtuous woman, not to go to a bath even with her husband's
permission: for the Prophet said, "Whatever woman enters a bath, the devil is with
her." As the bath is a resort of the Jinn, prayer should not be performed in it, nor
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n recited. The Prophet said, "All the earth is given to me as a place of
prayer, and as pure, except the burial-ground and the bath."<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Hence also, when a
person is about to enter a bath, he should offer up an ejaculatory prayer for protection
against evil spirits; and should place his left foot first over the threshold.&mdash;Infidels have
often been obliged to distinguish themselves in the bath, by hanging a signet to the
neck, or wearing anklets, &amp;c., lest they should receive those marks of respect which
should be paid only to believers.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II17" id="II17">17.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Meals, and the Manner of Eating.</i> The King (with the sage as his
guest) is here described as eating in the presence of his court, agreeably with a common
custom of Eastern princes and other great men in the present day; the simple manner
in which the meal is served and eaten occasioning but a slight interruption.</p>

<p>The Muslim takes a light breakfast after the morning-prayers, and dinner after the
noon-prayers; or a single meal instead of these two, before noon. His principal meal
is supper, which is taken after the prayers of sunset. A man of rank or wealth, when
he has no guest, generally eats alone; his children eat after him, or with his wife or
wives. In all his repasts he is moderate with regard to the quantity which he eats,
however numerous the dishes.</p>

<p>In the times to which most of the tales in the present work relate, it appears that
the dishes were sometimes, I believe generally, placed upon a round embroidered cloth
spread on the floor, and sometimes on a tray, which was either laid on the floor or
upon a small stand or stool. The last is the mode now always followed in the houses of
the higher and middle classes of the Arabs. The table is usually placed upon a round
cloth, spread in the middle of the floor, or in a corner, next two of the deew&aacute;ns, or low
seats which generally extend along three sides of the room. It is composed of a large
round tray of silver, or of tinned copper, or of brass, supported by a stool, commonly
about fifteen or sixteen inches high, made of wood, and generally inlaid with mother-of-pearl
and ebony or other wood, or tortoise-shell, &amp;c. When there are numerous guests,
two or more such tables are prepared. The dishes are of silver, or of tinned copper, or
of china. Several of these are placed upon the tray; and around them are disposed
some round, flat cakes of bread, with spoons of box-wood, ebony, or other material, and,
usually, two or three limes, cut in halves, to be squeezed over certain of the dishes.
When these preparations have been made, each person who is to partake of the repast
receives a napkin; and a servant pours water over his hands. A basin and ewer of
either of the metals first mentioned are employed for this purpose; the former has a
cover with a receptacle for a piece of soap in its centre, and with numerous perforations
through which the water runs during the act of washing, so that it is not seen when
the basin is brought from one person to another. It is indispensably requisite to wash
at least the right hand before eating with the fingers anything but dry food; and the
mouth, also, is often rinsed, the water being taken up into it from the right hand.
The company sit upon the floor, or upon cushions, or some of them on the deew&aacute;n,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
either cross-legged, or with the right knee raised:<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> they retain the napkins before
mentioned; or a long napkin, sufficient to surround the tray, is placed upon their knees;
and each person, before he begins to eat, says, "In the name of God," or "In the name
of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful." The master of the house begins first: if he
did not so, some persons would suspect that the food was poisoned. The thumb and
two fingers of the right hand serve instead of knives and forks; and it is the usual
custom for a person to help himself to a portion of the contents of a dish by drawing it
towards the edge, or taking it from the edge, with a morsel of bread, which he eats with
it: when he takes too large a portion for a single mouthful, he generally places it on
his cake of bread. He takes from any dish that pleases him; and sometimes a host
hands a delicate morsel with his fingers to one of his guests. It is not allowable to
touch food with the left hand (as it is used for unclean purposes), excepting in a few
cases, when both hands are required to divide a joint.</p>

<p>Among the more common dishes are the following:&mdash;lamb or mutton cut into small
pieces, and stewed with various vegetables, and sometimes with peaches, apricots, or
jujubes, and sugar; cucumbers or small gourds, or the fruit of the black or white egg-plant,
stuffed with rice and minced meat, &amp;c.; vine-leaves or pieces of lettuce-leaf or
cabbage-leaf, enclosing a similar composition; small morsels of lamb or mutton, roasted
on skewers, and called "keb&aacute;b;" fowls simply roasted or boiled, or boned, and stuffed
with raisins, pistachio-nuts, crumbled bread, and parsley; and various kinds of pastry,
and other sweets. The repast is frequently commenced with soup; and is generally
ended with boiled rice, mixed with a little butter, and seasoned with salt and pepper;
or after this, is served a water-melon or other fruit, or a bowl of a sweet drink composed
of water with raisins, and sometimes other kinds of fruit, boiled in it, and then sugar,
and with a little rose-water added to it when cool. The meat, having generally little
fat, is cooked with clarified butter, and is so thoroughly done that it is easily divided
with the fingers.</p>

<p>A whole lamb, stuffed in the same manner as the fowls above mentioned, is not a
very uncommon dish; but one more extraordinary, of which 'Abd-El-La&#7789;eef gives an
account<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> as one of the most remarkable that he had seen in Egypt, I am tempted to
describe. It was an enormous pie, composed in the following manner:&mdash;Thirty pounds
of fine flour being kneaded with five pounds and a half of oil of sesame, and divided into
two equal portions, one of these was spread upon a round tray of copper, about four spans
in diameter. Upon this were placed three lambs, stuffed with pounded meat fried with
oil of sesame and ground pistachio-nuts, and various hot aromatics, such as pepper,
ginger, cinnamon, mastic, coriander-seed, cumin-seed, cardamom, nut [or nutmeg?], &amp;c.
These were then sprinkled with rose-water infused with musk; and upon the lambs,
and in the remaining spaces, were placed twenty fowls, twenty chickens, and fifty
smaller birds; some of which were baked, and stuffed with eggs; some, stuffed with
meat; and some, fried with the juice of sour grapes, or that of limes, or some similar
acid. To the above were added a number of small pies; some filled with meat, and
others with sugar and sweetmeats; and sometimes, the meat of another lamb, cut into
small pieces, and some fried cheese. The whole being piled up in the form of a dome,
some rose-water infused with musk and aloes-wood was sprinkled upon it; and the other
half of the paste first mentioned was spread over, so as to close the whole: it was then
baked, wiped with a sponge, and again sprinkled with rose-water infused with musk.&mdash;A
dish still more extraordinary will be described in a note on public Royal feasts.</p>

<p>With respect to clean and unclean meats, the Muslim is subject to nearly the same
laws as the Jew. Swine's flesh, and blood, are especially forbidden to him; but camel's
flesh is allowed. The latter, however, being of a coarse nature, is never eaten when any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
other meat can be obtained, excepting by persons of the lower classes, and by Arabs of
the desert. Of fish, almost every kind is eaten (excepting shell-fish), usually fried in
oil: of game, little; partly in consequence of frequent doubt whether it have been lawfully
killed. The diet consists, in a great measure, of vegetables, and includes a large
variety of pastry. A very common kind of pastry is a pancake, which is made very thin,
and folded over several times like a napkin; it is saturated with butter, and generally
sweetened with honey or sugar; as is also another common kind, which somewhat
resembles vermicelli.</p>

<p>The usual beverage at meals is water, which is drunk from cooling, porous, earthen
bottles, or from cups of brass or other metal: but in the houses of the wealthy, sherbet
is sometimes served instead of this, in covered glass cups, each of which contains about
three quarters of a pint. The sherbet is composed of water made very sweet with sugar,
or with a hard conserve of violets or roses or mulberries, &amp;c. After every time that a
person drinks, he says, "Praise be to God;" and each person of the company says to
him, "May it be productive of enjoyment:" to which he replies, "May God cause thee
to have enjoyment." The Arabs drink little or no water during a meal, but generally
take a large draught immediately after. The repast is quickly finished; and each
person, as soon as he has done, says, "Praise be to God," or "Praise be to God, the
Lord of all creatures." He then washes, in the same manner as before, but more
thoroughly; well lathering his beard, and rinsing his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II18" id="II18">18.</a></span> This mode of shewing honour to a meritorious individual, or distinguished
guest, which is at least as ancient as the time of Ahasuerus,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> is still observed
in Muslim countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II19" id="II19">19.</a></span> The influence of the stars upon the dispositions and fortunes of mankind
is firmly believed by the generality of Muslims, and is often a matter of consideration
previously to the uniting of two persons in marriage; though the absurdity of such an
opinion is declared in their law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II20" id="II20">20.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Distribution of Virtues and Vices among Mankind.</i> I have heard
Arabs confess that their nation possesses nine-tenths of the envy that exists among all
mankind collectively; but I have not seen any written authority for this. Ibn-'Abb&aacute;s
assigns nine-tenths of the intrigue or artifice that exists in the world to the Copts;
nine-tenths of the perfidy, to the Jews; nine-tenths of the stupidity, to the Maghrabees;
nine-tenths of the hardness, to the Turks; and nine-tenths of the bravery, to the
Arabs. According to Ka&#7841;b-El-A&#7717;b&aacute;r, reason and sedition are most peculiar to Syria;
plenty and degradation, to Egypt; and misery and health, to the Desert. In another
account, faith and modesty are said to be most peculiar to El-Yemen; fortitude and
sedition, to Syria; magnificence, or pride, and hypocrisy, to El-'Er&aacute;&#7731;; wealth and
degradation, to Egypt; and poverty and misery, to the Desert.&mdash;Of women, it is said,
by Ka&#7841;b-El-A&#7717;b&aacute;r, that the best in the world (excepting those of the tribe of &#7730;ureysh
mentioned by the Prophet) are those of El-Ba&#7779;rah; and the worst in the world, those
of Egypt."<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II21" id="II21">21.</a></span> In the Cairo edition, King Yoon&aacute;n is made to say, "I should repent after
it, as King Sindib&aacute;d repented of killing the falcon;"&mdash;and thus is introduced an
indifferent story in the place of that of the Husband and the Parrot; the former story
describing a king as having, under an erroneous idea, killed a falcon that had prevented
his drinking poison. The latter story I insert in preference, according to the Calcutta
edition of the first two hundred nights, and the edition of Breslau.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II22" id="II22">22.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Miraculously-gifted Birds.</i> An Arab historian would make it to appear,
that the intelligence and talent ascribed to this parrot are not nearly so wonderful as
those which some birds have been known to display. He mentions a parrot which
recited the Soorat Y&aacute;-Seen (or 36th chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n); and a raven which recited
the Soorat es-Sijdeh (or 32nd chapter), and which, on arriving at the place of prostra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>tion
(or verse which should be recited with prostration), would perform that action, and
say, "My body prostrateth itself to Thee, and my heart confideth in Thee." But these
are not the most remarkable cases of the kind. He affirms that there was a parrot in
Cairo which recited the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n from beginning to end. The B&aacute;sh&agrave;, he says, desiring
to try its talent, caused a man to recite a chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n in its presence, and to
pass irregularly from one chapter to another, with the view of leading the bird into
error: but, instead of this being the result, the parrot corrected him!<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II23" id="II23">23.</a></span> But a few years ago, it was a common custom for an Arab merchant or
shopkeeper of the higher class to wear a sword; and this not only during a journey,
but also during his ordinary walks or rides. I have seen many persons of this description
so armed, and with a pair of pistols stuck in the girdle; though seldom excepting
in the former case. A dagger or case-knife is a weapon now more commonly worn by
such persons, both at home and abroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II24" id="II24">24.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Hunting and Hawking.</i> Hunting and hawking, which were common
and favourite diversions of the Arabs, and especially of their kings and other great men,
have now fallen into comparative disuse among this people. They are, however, still
frequently practised by the Persians, and in a manner the same as they are generally
described in the present work. Sir John Malcolm was informed that these sports were
nowhere found in greater perfection than in the neighbourhood of Aboo-Shahr, where
he witnessed and took part in them: I shall, therefore, here avail myself of his
observations on this subject.</p>

<p>"The huntsmen," he says, "proceed to a large plain, or rather desert, near the
sea-side: they have hawks and greyhounds; the former carried in the usual manner, on
the hand of the huntsman; the latter led in a leash by a horseman, generally the same
who carries the hawk. When the antelope is seen, they endeavour to get as near as
possible; but the animal, the moment it observes them, goes off at a rate that seems
swifter than the wind: the horsemen are instantly at full speed, having slipped the
dogs. If it is a single deer, they at the same time fly the hawks; but if a herd, they
wait till the dogs have fixed on a particular antelope. The hawks, skimming along
near the ground, soon reach the deer, at whose head they pounce in succession, and
sometimes with a violence that knocks it over. [They are commonly described as pecking
at the poor creature's eyes until they blind it.] At all events, they confuse the
animal so much as to stop its speed in such a degree that the dogs can come up with
it; and, in an instant, men, horses, dogs, and hawks, surround the unfortunate deer,
against which their united efforts have been combined. The part of the chase that
surprised me most, was the extraordinary combination of the hawks and the dogs,
which throughout seemed to look to each other for aid. This, I was told, was the
result of long and skilful training.&mdash;The antelope is supposed to be the fleetest
quadruped on earth; and the rapidity of the first burst of the chase I have described
is astonishing. The run seldom exceeds three or four miles, and often is not half so
much. A fawn is an easy victory; the doe often runs a good chase; and the buck is
seldom taken. The Arabs are, indeed, afraid to fly their hawks at the latter, as these
fine birds, in pouncing, frequently impale themselves on its sharp horns.&mdash;The hawks
used in this sport are of a species that I have never seen in any other country. This
breed, which is called Cherkh, is not large, but of great beauty and symmetry.</p>

<p>"Another mode of running down the antelope is practised here, and still more in
the interior of Persia. Persons of the highest rank lead their own greyhounds in a
long silken leash, which passes through the collar, and is ready to slip the moment the
huntsman chooses. The well-trained dog goes alongside the horse, and keeps clear of
him when at full speed, and in all kinds of country. When a herd of antelopes is seen,
a consultation is held, and the most experienced determine the point towards which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
they are to be driven. The field (as an English sportsman would term it) then disperse,
and, while some drive the herd in the desired direction, those with the dogs take their
post on the same line, at the distance of about a mile from each other; one of the worst
dogs is then slipped at the herd, and from the moment he singles out an antelope the
whole body are in motion. The object of the horsemen who have greyhounds is to
intercept its course, and to slip fresh dogs, in succession, at the fatigued animal. In
rare instances, the second dog kills. It is generally the third or fourth; and even
these, when the deer is strong, and the ground favourable, often fail. This sport, which
is very exhilarating, was the delight of the late King of Persia, &Aacute;gh&agrave; Mo&#7717;ammad
Kh&aacute;n, whose taste is inherited by the present sovereign.</p>

<p>"The novelty of these amusements interested me, and I was pleased, on accompanying
a party to a village, about twenty miles from Aboo-Shahr, to see a species of hawking
peculiar, I believe, to the sandy plains of Persia, on which the &#7716;ob&aacute;r&agrave;, a noble
species of bustard, is found on almost bare plains, where it has no shelter but a small
shrub called 'geetuck.' When we went in quest of them, we had a party of about
twenty, all well mounted. Two kinds of hawks are necessary for this sport; the first,
the Cherkh (the same which is flown at the antelope), attacks them on the ground, but
will not follow them on the wing; for this reason, the 'Bhyree,' a hawk well known in
India, is flown the moment the &#7716;ob&aacute;r&agrave; rises.&mdash;As we rode along in an extended line,
the men who carried the Cherkhs every now and then unhooded and held them up,
that they might look over the plain. The first &#7716;ob&aacute;r&agrave; we found afforded us a proof of
the astonishing quickness of sight of one of the hawks: he fluttered to be loose, and
the man who held him gave him a whoop as he threw him off his hand, and set off at
full speed. We all did the same. At first we only saw our hawk skimming over the
plain, but soon perceived, at a distance of more than a mile, the beautiful speckled
&#7716;ob&aacute;r&agrave;, with his head erect and wings outspread, running forward to meet his adversary.
The Cherkh made several unsuccessful pounces, which were either evaded or
repelled by the beak or wings of the &#7716;ob&aacute;r&agrave;, which at last found an opportunity of
rising, when a Bhyree was instantly flown, and the whole party were again at full
gallop. We had a flight of more than a mile, when the &#7716;ob&aacute;r&agrave; alighted, and was killed
by another Cherkh, who attacked him on the ground. This bird weighed ten pounds.
We killed several others, but were not always successful, having seen our hawks twice
completely beaten, during the two days we followed this fine sport."<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>The hunting of the wild ass is another sport of the Persians and Arabs, but one of a
more difficult nature. This animal is found in Syria, and in the Nubian deserts, as
well as in Arabia and Persia. The more common kinds of game are gazelles, or antelopes,
hares, partridges, the species of grouse called "&#7731;a&#7789;&agrave;," quails, wild geese, ducks,
&amp;c. Against all of these, the hawk is generally employed, but assisted in the capture
of gazelles and hares by dogs. The usual arms of the sportsmen, in the times to which
the present work relates, were the bow and arrow, the cross-bow, the spear, the sword,
and the mace. When the game is struck down, but not killed, by any weapon, its
throat is immediately cut. If merely stunned, and then left to die, its flesh is unlawful
food. Some other laws respecting the killing of game have been mentioned in a former
note; but one has been there omitted which is worthy of remark, though it is often
disregarded; it is, that hunting is allowable only for the purpose of procuring food, or
to obtain the skin of an animal, or for the sake of destroying ferocious and dangerous
beasts. Amusement is certainly, in general, the main object of the Muslim huntsman,
but he does not, with this view, endeavour to prolong the chase; on the contrary, he
strives to take the game as quickly as possible; for this purpose, nets are often employed,
and the hunting party, forming what is called the circle of the chase (&#7717;al&#7731;at e&#7779;-&#7779;eyd),
surround the spot in which the game is found.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>
<p>"On the eastern frontiers of Syria," says Burckhardt, "are several places allotted for
the hunting of gazelles: these places are called 'masiade' [more properly, 'ma&#7779;yedehs'].
An open space in the plain, of about one mile and a half square, is enclosed on three
sides by a wall of loose stones, too high for the gazelles to leap over. In different parts
of this wall, gaps are purposely left, and near each gap a deep ditch is made on the
outside. The enclosed space is situated near some rivulet or spring to which, in summer,
the gazelles resort. When the hunting is to begin, many peasants assemble, and watch
till they see a herd of gazelles advancing from a distance towards the enclosure, into
which they drive them: the gazelles, frightened by the shouts of these people, and the
discharge of fire-arms, endeavour to leap over the wall, but can only effect this at the
gaps, where they fall into the ditch outside, and are easily taken, sometimes by hundreds.

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II25" id="II25">25.</a></span> In the Cairo edition, the word "jezeereh" (an island) is erroneously put

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II26" id="II26">26.</a></span> "Ghooleh" is the feminine of "Ghool." The Ghool is a fabulous being,

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II27" id="II27">27.</a></span> This epithet of the Deity appears to be used in preference to others in this
instance, in order to imply that God always decrees what is best for a virtuous man,
even when the reverse would seem to us to be the case. He is here described as
appointing that the sage should die a violent death; but this death, being unmerited,
raised him, according to Mohammadan notions, to the rank of a martyr.</p>

<p>In the edition from which my translation is chiefly made, four poetical quotations
are here inserted on the subject of fate, and the inutility of anxious forebodings. The
first of these is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O thou who fearest thy fate, be at ease; commit thine affairs unto Him who spread out the earth.</span>
<span class="i0">For what is predestined cannot be cancelled; and thou art secure from every thing that is not predestined."</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II28" id="II28">28.</a></span>&mdash;<i>The Fable of the Crocodile.</i> Perhaps the reader may desire to know what is
the story which the sage Doob&aacute;n declined to relate; I will therefore supply the omission
as well as my memory will allow me. I have heard this fable differently told by different
persons; and it is sometimes spun out to a considerable length; but the principal
points of it are these:&mdash;A crocodile, having crawled far from the Nile, over a desert
tract, found his strength so exhausted by fatigue and thirst, that he despaired of being
able to return to the river. While he was in this unhappy state, an Arab with his
camel approached him, proceeding in the desired direction; and he appealed to his
compassion, entreating that he would bind him on the back of the camel, and so convey
him to the Nile, and promising that he would afterwards, in return for this favour,
carry him across to the opposite bank. The Arab answered, that he feared the crocodile
would, as soon as he was unbound, turn upon him, and devour him; but the
monster swore so solemnly that he would gratefully requite the service he requested,
that the man was induced to consent; and, making his camel lie down, bound the
crocodile firmly upon his back, and brought him to the bank of the river. No sooner,
however, was the horrid creature liberated, than, in spite of his vows, he opened his
hideous jaws to destroy his benefactor, who, though he eluded this danger, was unable
to rescue his camel. At this moment a fox drew near them. The man, accosting this
cunning animal, related his tale; and the crocodile urged in his own excuse, that the
man had spitefully bound him on the back of the camel in such a manner that he had
almost killed him. The fox replied that he could quickly pursue and capture the man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
but that he must act fairly, and first see the whole transaction repeated before him.
The crocodile, assenting, and submitting to have a noose thrown over his jaws, was
again bound on the back of the camel, and taken to the place whence he was brought;
and as soon as this was done, the man, by the direction of the fox, holding with one
hand the halter of his camel, with the other cut the ropes which secured his burden,
and hasted away with his beast, leaving the ungrateful and treacherous monster in the
same hopeless state in which he had found him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II29" id="II29">29.</a></span> This comparison is perfectly just. My first visit to Egypt was not too
late for me to witness such a scene as that which is here alluded to; but now, throughout
the Turkish dominions, the officers of government are obliged, more or less, to
assimilate their style of dress to that which commonly prevails in Europe; gaudy
colours are out of fashion among them, and silk embroidery is generally preferred to
gold: in Egypt, however, the dress worn by this class of persons has not been so much
altered as in Turkey, still retaining an Oriental character, though wanting the shawl
which was wound round the red cap, and formed the turban; while the dress worn by
other classes has undergone no change. [This note still applies to the inhabitants of
Egypt, with the exception of the Turks, who have very generally adopted the modern
Turkish, or semi-European dress.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II30" id="II30">30.</a></span> This story of the head speaking after it was cut off is not without a
parallel in the writings of Arab historians. The head of Sa'eed, the son of Jubeyr, is
said to have uttered the words, "There is no deity but God," after it had been severed
from his body by order of El-&#7716;ajj&aacute;j, who is related to have killed a hundred and twenty
thousand persons of note, besides those whom he slew in war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II31" id="II31">31.</a></span> I do not remember to have read or heard the story of Um&aacute;meh and
'&Aacute;tikeh, who, as their names import, were two females.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II32" id="II32">32.</a></span> The words here quoted are part of the 36th verse of the 17th chapter of
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II33" id="II33">33.</a></span> The title of "Sul&#7789;&aacute;n" is higher than that of "Melik" (or King): a
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, properly speaking, being a monarch who has kings or viceroys under his
authority.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II34" id="II34">34.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On</i> Ko&#7717;l, <i>and the mode of applying it</i>. Ko&#7717;l is a black powder, with which
most of the Arab, and many other, women blacken the edges of the eyelids. The most
common kind is the smoke-black which is produced by burning a kind of frankincense.
An inferior kind is the smoke-black produced by burning the shells of almonds. These
are believed to be beneficial to the eyes; but are generally used merely for the sake of
ornament. Among other kinds which are particularly employed for their beneficial
effect upon the eye are several ores of lead, reduced to a fine powder. Antimony is
said to have been, in former times, the most esteemed kind of ko&#7717;l. The powder is
applied by means of a small probe of wood, ivory, or silver, the end of which is moistened,
and then dipped in the powder, and drawn along the edges of the eyelids.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II35" id="II35">35.</a></span> The Koofeeyeh is described in a great Arabic Lexicon (T&aacute;j el-'Aroos) as
"a thing worn on the head; so called because of its roundness:" and this is the only
description of it that I have been able to find. I was told in Cairo, that "koofeeyeh"
is the correct appellation of the head-kerchief commonly called "keffeeyeh:" but this is
a mistake. The latter is a square kerchief, which is worn on the head, measuring about
a yard in each direction, and of various colours, generally a dull, brownish red, bright
green, and yellow, composing broad and narrow stripes, and having a deep fringe of
strings and tassels along two opposite edges. The most common kind is entirely of
cotton; another, of cotton interwoven with silk; and a third, of silk interwoven with
gold. It is now chiefly worn by the Wahh&aacute;bees and several tribes of Bedawees; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the former wear only the first kind, as they hold articles of dress composed wholly or
partly of silk or gold to be unlawful. In former times it was in common use among
the inhabitants of the towns. It is mostly worn by men, and is doubled diagonally, and
placed over the cap in such a manner that the two corners which are folded together
hang down the back; and the other two corners, in front. A piece of woollen rope, or a
strip of rag, or a turban, is generally wound round it; and the corners, or those only which
usually hang down in front, are sometimes turned up, and tucked within the upper
edge of the turban. The inhabitants of the towns usually wear the turban over the
keffeeyeh. Burckhardt, who calls this head-kerchief "keffie," mentions, that the
Bedawees of Mekkeh and El-Yemen tie over it, instead of the woollen rope which is
used by the Northern Bedawees, "a circle made of wax, tar, and butter, strongly kneaded
together: this," he adds, "is pressed down to the middle of the head, and looks like
the airy crown of a saint. It is about the thickness of a finger; and they take it off
very frequently to press it between their hands, so that its shape may be preserved."<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
The better kinds of keffeeyeh above mentioned are worn by some of the Turks, but not
in the Arab manner; being wound tight round the cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II36" id="II36">36.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Anecdote of a Miraculous Fish.</i> This story of the miraculous fish reminds
me of one of a similar kind which is related as authentic. A certain just judge of the
Israelites, in the time of Solomon, had a wife who, every time that she brought him his
food, used to ejaculate a prayer that disgrace might befall every unfaithful wife. One
day, this woman having placed before her husband a fried fish, and repeated her usual
ejaculation, the fish leaped from the dish, and fell upon the floor. This happened three
times; and, in consequence of a suspicion expressed by a devotee, who was consulted
respecting the meaning of this strange event, the judge discovered that a supposed
maid, whom he had purchased as a slave, was a disguised man.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II37" id="II37">37.</a></span> This comparison is not intended to be understood in its literal sense, for
the smallest of the tribe of '&Aacute;d is said to have been sixty cubits high: the largest, a
hundred! The tribe of '&Aacute;d were a race of ancient Arabs, who, according to the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n
and Arab historians, were destroyed by a suffocating wind, for their infidelity, after
their rejection of the admonitions of the prophet Hood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II38" id="II38">38.</a></span> The Arabs generally calculate distances by time. The average distance
of a day's journey is from twenty to twenty-five miles; the former being the usual rate
of caravan-travelling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II39" id="II39">39.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Privacy of Arab Dwellings.</i> In a palace, or large house, there is
generally a wide bench of stone, or a wooden couch, within the outer door, for the accommodation
of the door-keeper and other servants. The entrance-passage leads to an
open court, and, for the sake of preventing persons at the entrance, or a little within it,
from seeing into the court, it usually has two turnings. We may, therefore, understand
the motive of the King in seating himself in the place here described to have
been a desire that he might not, if discovered, be supposed to be prying impertinently
into the interior of the palace. Respect for the privacy of another's house is a point
that is deemed of so much importance that it is insisted upon in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, in these
words:&mdash;"O ye who have become believers, enter not any houses, besides your own
houses, until ye shall have asked leave, and saluted their inhabitants; this will be better
for you: peradventure ye will be admonished. And if ye find not in them any person,
enter them not, until leave be granted you; and if it be said unto you, Return, then
do ye return; this will be more decent for you; and God knoweth what ye do. But it
shall be no crime in you that ye enter uninhabited houses wherein ye may find a convenience.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>
When a visiter finds the door open, and no servant below, he usually claps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
his hands as a signal for some person to come to him; striking the palm of his left
hand with the fingers of the right: and even when leave has been granted him to enter,
it is customary for him, when he has to ascend to an upper apartment, to repeat several
times some ejaculation, such as "Permission!" or, "O Protector!" (that is, "O protecting
God!"), as he goes up, in order that any female of the family, who may chance to
be in the way, may have notice of his approach, and either retire or veil herself.
Sometimes the servant who precedes him does this in his stead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II40" id="II40">40.</a></span> These verses are translated from the Calcutta edition of the first two
hundred nights, as more apposite than those which are inserted in their place in the
edition of Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II41" id="II41">41.</a></span> That the reader may not form wrong conceptions of the characters of
many persons portrayed in this work, it is necessary to observe, that weeping is not regarded
by the Arabs as an evidence of an effeminate disposition, or inconsistent with
even a heroic mind; though the Muslims in general are remarkable for the calmness
with which they endure the heaviest afflictions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II42" id="II42">42.</a></span> It is, perhaps, unnecessary to mention, that it is a common custom of the
Orientals, as of other natives of warm climates, to take a nap in the afternoon. A
tradesman is not unfrequently seen enjoying this luxury in his shop, and seldom, excepting
in this case, is it considered allowable to wake a person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II43" id="II43">43.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Description of Arab Fans.</i> The kind of fan most commonly used by the
Arabs has the form of a small flag. The flap, which is about six or seven inches in
width, and somewhat more in length, is composed of split palm-leaves of various colours,
or some plain and others coloured, neatly plaited or woven together. The handle is a
piece of palm-stick, about twice the length of the flap. This fan is used by men as
well as women, and for the double purpose of moderating the heat and repelling the
flies, which, in warm weather, are excessively annoying. It is more effective than the
ordinary European fan, and requires less exertion. Arabian fans of the kind here
described, brought from Mekkeh to Cairo as articles of merchandise, may be purchased
in the latter city for a sum less than a penny each; they are mostly made in the H[.]ej&aacute;z.
Another kind of fan, generally composed of black ostrich-feathers, of large dimensions,
and ornamented with a small piece of looking-glass on the lower part of the front, is
often used by the Arabs. A kind of fly-whisk made of palm-leaves is also in very
general use. A servant or slave is often employed to wave it over the master or mistress
during a meal or an afternoon nap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II44" id="II44">44.</a></span> Mes'oodeh is the feminine of Mes'ood, a name before explained, as signifying
"happy," or "made happy."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II45" id="II45">45.</a></span> The word which I have here rendered "wine" (namely, "shar&aacute;b") is
applied to any drink, and particularly to a sweet beverage; but, in the present case, the
context shews that its signification is that which I have given it. The description of a
carousal in the next chapter will present a more fit occasion for my considering at large
the custom of drinking wine as existing among the Arabs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II46" id="II46">46.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Use of Hemp to induce Intoxication.</i> The name of "benj," or
"beng," is now, and, I believe, generally, given to henbane; but El-&#7730;azweenee states
that the leaves of the garden hemp (&#7731;inneb bust&aacute;nee, or shahd&aacute;naj,) are the benj which,
when eaten, disorders the reason. This is an important confirmation of De Sacy's
opinion respecting the derivation of the appellation of "Assassins" from &#7716;ashsh&aacute;sheen
(hemp-eaters, or persons who intoxicate themselves with hemp); as the sect which we
call "Assassins" are expressly said by the Arabs to have made frequent use of benj.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
To this subject I shall have occasion to revert. I need only add here, that the custom
of using benj, and other narcotics, for purposes similar to that described in this tale, is
said to be not very unfrequently practised in the present day; but as many Arab husbands
are extremely suspicious of the character of women in general, perhaps there is
but little ground for this assertion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II47" id="II47">47.</a></span> Most Eastern cities and towns are partly or wholly surrounded by
mounds of rubbish, close to the walls; and upon these mounds are thrown the carcasses
of camels, horses, and other beasts, to be devoured by dogs and vultures. Immense
mounds of this unsightly description entirely surrounded the city of Cairo; but those
which extended along its western side, and, in a great measure, screened it from the
view of persons approaching from the Nile, have lately been removed by order of the
present B&aacute;sh&agrave; of Egypt. [This note was written in the year 1838, in the time of
Mo&#7717;ammad 'Alee.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II48" id="II48">48.</a></span> "&#7730;ubbeh" generally signifies either a dome or a cupola, or a building
or apartment surmounted by a dome. In the present instance it is to be understood in
the latter sense. It is also applied to a closet, and to a tent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II49" id="II49">49.</a></span> "&#7730;&aacute;f" is generally to be understood, as it is in the present case; to
signify the chain of mountains believed, by the Muslims, to encircle our earth, as
mentioned in a former note. It is also the name of the chain of Caucasus, and hence
it has been supposed that the fable respecting the mountains before mentioned, originated
from an early idea that the chain of Caucasus was the limit of the habitable earth;
but it is possible that the latter mountains may have derived their name from an
imaginary resemblance to the former.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II50" id="II50">50.</a></span> Rats, though unlawful food to the Muslim, are occasionally eaten by
many of the peasants of the province of Lower Egypt called El-Bo&#7717;eyreh, on the west
of the western branch of the Nile. The extraordinary abundance of these animals, and
mice, throughout Egypt, gave rise to an absurd fable, which is related by Diodorus
Siculus<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> as a matter worthy of serious consideration:&mdash;that these creatures are generated
from the alluvial soil deposited by the Nile. The inundation drives many of
them from the fields to the houses and deserts, and destroys the rest; but soon after
the waters have subsided, vast numbers of them are seen again, taking refuge in the
deep clefts of the parched soil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II51" id="II51">51.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Beverage called</i> Boo&#7827;ah. Boo&#7827;ah, or boozeh, is a favourite beverage
of the boatmen, and other persons of the lower class, in Egypt; and more especially of
the Nubians and negroes; as it was, according to Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> and other writers, of the
ancient Egyptians. It is an intoxicating liquor, a kind of beer, most commonly prepared
from barley-bread, crumbled, mixed with water, strained, and left to ferment.
It is also prepared from wheat and from millet in the same manner. The account of
Herodotus has been confirmed by the discovery of large jars, containing the dregs of
the barley-beer in ancient tombs at Thebes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II52" id="II52">52.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Apparel, &amp;c., of Mourning.</i> The wearing of mourning appears to
have been a custom of both sexes among the Arabs in earlier times, for the black clothing
which distinguished the 'Abb&aacute;see Khaleefehs and their officers was originally
assumed in testimony of grief for the death of the Im&aacute;m Ibr&aacute;heem Ibn-Mo&#7717;ammad. It
has, however, ceased to be worn by men, as indicating a want of resignation to the
decrees of Providence, and is only assumed by women on the occasion of the death of a
husband or near relation, and not for an elderly person. In the former cases they dye
their shirts, head-veils, face-veils, and handkerchiefs, of a blue or almost black colour,
with indigo; and sometimes, with the same dye, stain their hands and arms as high as
the elbows, and smear the walls of their apartments. They generally abstain from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
wearing any article of dress of a bright colour, leave their hair unbraided, and deck
themselves with few or no ornaments. They also cease to make use of perfumes, ko&#7717;l,
and &#7717;enn&agrave;; and often turn upside-down the carpets, mats, cushions, and coverings of
the deew&aacute;ns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II53" id="II53">53.</a></span> "Houses of Lamentations," erected in burial-grounds for the accommodation
of ladies on the occasions of their visiting the tombs of their relations, have been
mentioned in a former note respecting the two grand annual festivals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II54" id="II54">54.</a></span> The kind of tomb here alluded to is generally a square building crowned
by a dome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II55" id="II55">55.</a></span> This passage deserves particular notice, as being one of those which assist
us to form some opinion respecting the period when the present work, in the states in
which it is known to us, was composed or compiled or remodelled. It is the same in
all the copies of the original work that I have seen, and bears strong evidence of having
been written subsequently to the commencement of the eighth century of the Flight, or
fourteenth of our era, at which period, it appears, the Christians and Jews were first
compelled to distinguish themselves by wearing, respectively, blue and yellow turbans,
in accordance with an order issued by the Sult&aacute;n of Egypt, Mo&#7717;ammad Ibn-Kala-oon.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>
Thus the white turban became peculiar to the Muslims.&mdash;An eminent German critic has
been unfortunate in selecting the incident of the four fish as affording an argument in
favour of his opinion that the Tales of a Thousand and One Nights are of Indian origin,
on the mere ground that the same word (<i>varna</i>) is used in Sanscrit to signify both "colour"
and "caste."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II56" id="II56">56.</a></span> The Muslims often implore the intercession of their prophet, and of
various members of his family and other holy persons, though their ordinary prayers
are addressed solely to God. The regard which they pay to their reputed saints, both
living and deceased, as mediators, is one of the heresies which the Wahh&aacute;bees most
vehemently condemn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II57" id="II57">57.</a></span> This verse, translated from my usual prototype, the Cairo edition, is
there followed by another, which I omit as being inapposite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II58" id="II58">58.</a></span> In the first of the notes to the Introduction, I have mentioned that it
is a general custom of the Muslims to repeat this phrase, "In the name of God!" on
commencing every lawful action that is of any importance; it is, therefore, here
employed, as it is in many similar cases, to express a readiness to do what is commanded
or requested; and is equivalent to saying, "I this instant begin to execute thy orders."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II59" id="II59">59.</a></span> The condition and offices of memlooks, who are male white slaves, have
been mentioned in the thirteenth note to the first chapter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="II60" id="II60">60.</a></span> Eastern histories present numerous instances of marriages as unequal as
those here related; the reader, therefore, must not regard this part of the story as
inconsistent.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h6>COMMENCING WITH PART OF THE NINTH NIGHT, AND ENDING WITH PART
OF THE EIGHTEENTH.</h6>

<hr />
<h5>THE STORY OF THE PORTER AND THE LADIES OF BAGHD&Aacute;D,
AND OF THE THREE ROYAL MENDICANTS, &amp;c.</h5>

<p>There was a man of the city of Baghd&aacute;d, who was unmarried, and
he was a porter; and one day, as he sat in the market, reclining
against his crate,<a href="#III1" class="fnanchor">1</a> there accosted him a female wrapped in an iz&aacute;r<a href="#III2" class="fnanchor">2</a> of
the manufacture of El-M&oacute;&#7779;il,<a href="#III3" class="fnanchor">3</a> composed of gold-embroidered silk,
with a border of gold lace at each end, who raised her face-veil, and
displayed beneath it a pair of black eyes, with lids bordered by long
lashes, exhibiting a tender expression, and features of perfect beauty;
and she said, with a sweet voice, Bring thy crate, and follow me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>The porter had scarcely heard her words when he took up his crate,
and he followed her until she stopped at the door of a house, and
knocked; whereupon there came down to her a Christian, and she
gave him a piece of gold, and received for it a quantity of olives, and
two large vessels of wine,<a href="#III4" class="fnanchor">4</a> which she placed in the crate, saying to
the porter, Take it up, and follow me. The porter exclaimed, This is,
indeed, a fortunate day!&mdash;and he took up the crate, and followed her.
She next stopped at the shop of a fruiterer, and bought of him Syrian
apples, and 'Othm&aacute;nee quinces,<a href="#III5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and peaches of 'Om&aacute;n, and jasmine
of Aleppo, and water-lilies of Damascus, and cucumbers of the Nile,
and Egyptian limes, and Sul&#7789;&aacute;nee citrons, and sweet-scented myrtle,
and sprigs of the &#7717;enn&agrave;-tree, and chamomile, and anemones, and violets,
and pomegranate flowers, and eglantine: all these she put into the
porter's crate, and said to him, Take it up. So he took it up, and
followed her until she stopped at the shop of a butcher, to whom
she said, Cut off ten pounds of meat;&mdash;and he cut it off for her, and
she wrapped it in a leaf of a banana-tree, and put it in the crate, and
said again, Take it up, O porter:&mdash;and he did so, and followed her.
She next stopped at the shop of a seller of dry fruits, and took some
of every kind of these, and desired the porter to take up his burden.
Having obeyed, he followed her until she stopped at the shop of a
confectioner, where she bought a dish, and filled it with sweets of
every kind that he had,<a href="#III6" class="fnanchor">6</a> which she put into the crate; whereupon
the porter ventured to say, If thou hadst informed me beforehand, I
had brought with me a mule to carry all these things. The lady
smiled at his remark, and next stopped at the shop of a perfumer, of
whom she bought ten kinds of scented waters; rose-water, and orange-flower-water,
and willow-flower-water,<a href="#III7" class="fnanchor">7</a> &amp;c.; together with some sugar,
and a sprinkling-bottle<a href="#III8" class="fnanchor">8</a> of rose-water infused with musk, and some
frankincense, and aloes-wood, and ambergris, and musk, and wax
candles; and, placing all these in the crate, she said, Take up thy
crate, and follow me. He, therefore, took it up, and followed her
until she came to a handsome house, before which was a spacious
court. It was a lofty structure, with a door of two leaves, composed
of ebony, overlaid with plates of red gold.<a href="#III9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The young lady stopped at this door, and knocked gently; whereupon
both its leaves were opened, and the porter, looking to see who
opened it, found it to be a damsel of tall stature, high-bosomed, fair
and beautiful, and of elegant form, with a forehead like the bright new
moon, eyes like those of gazelles, eyebrows like the new moon of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Rama&#7693;&aacute;n,<a href="#III10" class="fnanchor">10</a> cheeks resembling anemones, and a mouth like the seal of
Suleym&aacute;n:<a href="#III11" class="fnanchor">11</a> her countenance was like the full moon in its splendour,
and the forms of her bosom resembled two pomegranates of equal size.
When the porter beheld her, she captivated his reason, the crate nearly
fell from his head, and he exclaimed, Never in my life have I seen a
more fortunate day than this! The lady-portress, standing within the
door, said to the cateress and the porter, Ye are welcome:&mdash;and they
entered, and proceeded to a spacious saloon,<a href="#III12" class="fnanchor">12</a> decorated with various
colours, and beautifully constructed, with carved wood-work, and
fountains, and benches of different kinds, and closets with curtains
hanging before them; there was also in it, at the upper end,<a href="#III13" class="fnanchor">13</a> a couch
of alabaster inlaid with large pearls and jewels, with a musquito-curtain
of red satin suspended over it, and within this was a young lady with
eyes possessing the enchantment of B&aacute;bil,<a href="#III14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and a figure like the letter
Alif,<a href="#III15" class="fnanchor">15</a> with a face that put to shame the shining sun: she was like one
of the brilliant planets, or rather, one of the most high-born of the
maidens of Arabia. This third lady,<a href="#III16" class="fnanchor">16</a> rising from the couch, advanced
with a slow and elegant gait to the middle of the saloon, where her
sisters were standing, and said to them, Why stand ye still? Lift
down the burden from the head of this poor porter:&mdash;whereupon the
cateress placed herself before him, and the portress behind him,
and, the third lady assisting them, they lifted it down from his head.
They then took out the contents of the crate, and, having put every
thing in its place, gave to the porter two pieces of gold, saying to him,
Depart, O porter.</p>

<p>The porter, however, stood looking at the ladies, and admiring
their beauty and their agreeable dispositions; for he had never seen
any more handsome; and when he observed that they had not a man
among them, and gazed upon the wine, and fruits, and sweet-scented
flowers, which were there, he was full of astonishment, and hesitated
to go out; upon which one of the ladies said to him, Why dost thou
not go? dost thou deem thy hire too little? Then turning to one of
her sisters, she said to her, Give him another piece of gold.&mdash;By Allah,
O my mistress, exclaimed the porter, my hire is but two half-dirhems,<a href="#III17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
and I thought not what ye have given me too little; but my heart and
mind were occupied with reflections upon you and your state, ye being
alone, with no man among you, not one to amuse you with his company;
for ye know that the men&aacute;reh<a href="#III18" class="fnanchor">18</a> standeth not firmly but on four
walls: now ye have not a fourth, and the pleasure of women is not
complete without men: ye are three only, and have need of a fourth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
who should be a man, a person of sense, discreet, acute, and a concealer
of secrets. We are maidens, they replied; and fear to impart
our secret to him who will not keep it; for we have read, in a certain
history, this verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Guard thy secret from another: intrust it not: for he who intrusteth a secret hath lost it.</span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f55" id="f55"></a><img src="images/fig55.png" width="550" height="638" alt="The Porter pleading with the Three Ladies" title="The Porter pleading with the Three Ladies" /></div>

<p>&mdash;By your existence, said the porter, I am a man of sense, and trustworthy:
I have read various books, and perused histories: I make
known what is fair, and conceal what is foul, and act in accordance
with the saying of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">None keepeth a secret but a faithful person: with the best of mankind it remaineth concealed.</span>
<span class="i0">A secret is with me as in a house with a lock, whose key is lost, and whose door is sealed.<a href="#III19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the ladies heard the verses which he quoted, and the words with
which he addressed them, they said to him, Thou knowest that we
have expended here a considerable sum of money: hast thou then
wherewith to requite us? We will not suffer thee to remain with us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
unless thou contribute a sum of money; for thou desirest to sit with
us, and to be our cup-companion, and to gaze upon our beautiful faces.&mdash;If
friendship is without money, said the mistress of the house, it is
not equivalent to the weight of a grain:&mdash;and the portress added, If
thou hast nothing, depart with nothing:&mdash;but the cateress said, O
sister, let us suffer him; for, verily, he hath not been deficient in his
services for us this day: another had not been so patient with us:
whatever, therefore, falls to his share of the expense, I will defray for
him.&mdash;At this the porter rejoiced, and exclaimed, By Allah, I obtained
my first and only pay this day from none but thee:&mdash;and the other
ladies said to him, Sit down: thou art welcome.</p>

<p>The cateress then arose, and, having tightened her girdle, arranged
the bottles, and strained the wine, and prepared the table by the pool
of the fountain. She made ready all that they required, brought the
wine, and sat down with her sisters; the porter also sitting with them,
thinking he was in a dream. And when they had seated themselves,
the cateress took a jar of wine, and filled the first cup, and drank it:<a href="#III20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
she then filled another, and handed it to one of her sisters; and in like
manner she did to her other sister; after which she filled again, and
handed the cup to the porter, who, having taken it from her hand,
repeated this verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I will drink the wine, and enjoy health; for, verily, this beverage is a remedy for disease.</span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px; position: relative;"><a name="f56" id="f56"></a><img src="images/fig56.png" width="500" height="349" alt="The Porter and Ladies carousing" title="The Porter and Ladies carousing" /></div>

<p>The wine continued to circulate among them, and the porter, taking
his part in the revels, dancing and singing with them, and enjoying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the fragrant odours, began to hug and kiss them, while one slapped<a href="#III21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
him, and another pulled him, and the third beat him with sweet-scented
flowers, till, at length, the wine made sport with their reason;
and they threw off all restraint, indulging their merriment with as
much freedom as if no man had been present.<a href="#III22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Thus they continued until the approach of night, when they said
to the porter, Depart, and shew us the breadth of thy shoulders;<a href="#III23" class="fnanchor">23</a>&mdash;but
he replied, Verily the departure of my soul from my body were
more easy to me than my departure from your company; therefore
suffer us to join the night to the day, and then each of us shall return
to his own, or her own, affairs. The cateress, also, again interceded
for him, saying, By my life I conjure you that ye suffer him to pass
the night with us, that we may laugh at his drolleries, for he is a
witty rogue. So they said to him, Thou shalt pass the night with us
on this condition, that thou submit to our authority, and ask not an
explanation of anything that thou shalt see. He replied, Good.&mdash;Rise
then, said they, and read what is inscribed upon the door. Accordingly,
he went to the door, and found the following inscription upon
it in letters of gold, Speak not of that which doth not concern thee,
lest thou hear that which will not please thee:&mdash;and he said, Bear
witness to my promise that I will not speak of that which doth not
concern me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f57" id="f57"></a><img src="images/fig57.png" width="550" height="616" alt="The Three Royal Mendicants" title="The Three Royal Mendicants" /></div>

<p>The cateress then rose, and prepared for them a repast; and, after
they had eaten a little, they lighted the candles and burnt some aloes-wood.
This done, they sat down again to the table; and, while they
were eating and drinking, they heard a knocking at the door; whereupon,
without causing any interruption to their meal, one of them
went to the door, and, on her return, said, Our pleasure this night is
now complete, for I have found, at the door, three foreigners<a href="#III24" class="fnanchor">24</a> with
shaven chins, and each of them is blind of the left eye: it is an extraordinary
coincidence. They are strangers newly arrived,<a href="#III25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and each of
them has a ridiculous appearance: if they come in, therefore, we shall
be amused with laughing at them.&mdash;The lady ceased not with these
words, but continued to persuade her sisters until they consented, and
said, Let them enter; but make it a condition with them that they
speak not of that which doth not concern them, lest they hear that
which will not please them. Upon this she rejoiced, and, having gone
again to the door, brought in the three men blind of one eye and with
shaven chins, and they had thin and twisted mustaches. Being mendicants,
they saluted and drew back; but the ladies rose to them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
seated them; and when these three men looked at the porter, they saw
that he was intoxicated; and, observing him narrowly, they thought
that he was one of their own class, and said, He is a mendicant like
ourselves, and will amuse us by his conversation:&mdash;but the porter,
hearing what they said, arose, and rolled his eyes, and exclaimed to
them, Sit quiet, and abstain from impertinent remarks. Have ye not
read the inscription upon the door?&mdash;The ladies, laughing, said to each
other, Between the mendicants and the porter we shall find matter for
amusement. They then placed before the former some food, and they
ate, and then sat to drink. The portress handed to them the wine,
and, as the cup was circulating among them, the porter said to them,
Brothers, have ye any tale or strange anecdote wherewith to amuse us?
The mendicants, heated by the wine, asked for musical instruments;
and the portress brought them a tambourine of the manufacture of El-M&oacute;&#7779;il,
with a lute of El-'Er&aacute;&#7731;, and a Persian harp;<a href="#III26" class="fnanchor">26</a> whereupon they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
all arose; and one took the tambourine; another, the lute; and the
third, the harp: and they played upon these instruments, the ladies
accompanying them with loud songs; and while they were thus diverting
themselves, a person knocked at the door. The portress, therefore,
went to see who was there; and the cause of the knocking was
this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f58" id="f58"></a><img src="images/fig58.png" width="550" height="440" alt="The Concert of the Mendicants" title="The Concert of the Mendicants" /></div>

<p>The Khaleefeh<a href="#III27" class="fnanchor">27</a> H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed had gone forth this night to
see and hear what news he could collect, accompanied by Ja&#7841;far<a href="#III28" class="fnanchor">28</a> his
Wezeer, and Mesroor<a href="#III29" class="fnanchor">29</a> his executioner. It was his custom to disguise
himself in the attire of a merchant; and this night, as he went through
the city, he happened to pass, with his attendants, by the house of
these ladies, and hearing the sounds of the musical instruments, he
said to Ja&#7841;far, I have a desire to enter this house, and to see who is
giving this concert.&mdash;They are a party who have become intoxicated,
replied Ja&#7841;far, and I fear that we may experience some ill usage from
them;&mdash;but the Khaleefeh said, We must enter, and I would that thou
devise some stratagem by which we may obtain admission to the
inmates. Ja&#7841;far therefore answered, I hear and obey:&mdash;and he
advanced, and knocked at the door; and when the portress came and
opened the door, he said to her, My mistress, we are merchants from
Tabareeyeh,<a href="#III30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and have been in Baghd&aacute;d ten days; we have brought
with us merchandise, and taken lodgings in a Kh&aacute;n;<a href="#III31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and a merchant
invited us to an entertainment this night: accordingly, we went to his
house, and he placed food before us, and we ate, and sat awhile drinking
together, after which he gave us leave to depart;<a href="#III32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and going out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
in the dark, and being strangers, we missed our way to the Kh&aacute;n: we
trust, therefore, in your generosity that you will admit us to pass the
night in your house; by doing which you will obtain a reward in
heaven.&mdash;The portress, looking at them, and observing that they were
in the garb of merchants, and that they bore an appearance of respectability,
returned, and consulted her two companions; and they said
to her, Admit them:&mdash;so she returned, and opened to them the door.
They said to her, Shall we enter with thy permission? She answered,
Come in. The Khaleefeh, therefore, entered, with Ja&#7841;far and Mesroor;
and when the ladies saw them, they rose to them, and served them,
saying, Welcome are our guests; but we have a condition to impose
upon you, that ye speak not of that which doth not concern you, lest
ye hear that which will not please you. They answered, Good:&mdash;and
when they had sat down to drink, the Khaleefeh looked at the three
mendicants, and was surprised at observing that each of them was
blind of the left eye; and he gazed upon the ladies, and was perplexed
and amazed at their fairness and beauty. And when the others proceeded
to drink and converse, the ladies brought wine to the Khaleefeh;
but he said, I am a pilgrim;<a href="#III33" class="fnanchor">33</a>&mdash;and drew back from them.
Whereupon the portress spread before him an embroidered cloth, and
placed upon it a China bottle, into which she poured some willow-flower-water,
adding to it a lump of ice, and sweetening it with sugar,
while the Khaleefeh thanked her, and said within himself, To-morrow
I must reward her for this kind action.</p>

<p>The party continued their carousal, and, when the wine took effect
upon them, the mistress of the house arose, and waited upon them;
and afterwards, taking the hand of the cateress, said, Arise, O my
sister, that we may fulfil our debt. She replied, Good. The portress
then rose, and, after she had cleared the middle of the saloon, placed
the mendicants at the further end, beyond the doors; after which, the
ladies called to the porter, saying, How slight is thy friendship! thou
art not a stranger, but one of the family. So the porter arose, and
girded himself, and said, What would ye?&mdash;to which one of the ladies
answered, Stand where thou art:&mdash;and presently the cateress said to
him, Assist me:&mdash;and he saw two black bitches, with chains attached
to their necks, and drew them to the middle of the saloon; whereupon
the mistress of the house arose from her place, and tucked up her
sleeve above her wrist, and, taking a whip, said to the porter, Bring to
me one of them. Accordingly, he dragged one forward by the chain.
The bitch whined, and shook her head at the lady; but the latter fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
to beating her upon the head, notwithstanding her howling, until her
arms were tired, when she threw the whip from her hand, and pressed
the bitch to her bosom, and wiped away her tears, and kissed her
head; after which she said to the porter, Take her back, and bring the
other;&mdash;and he brought her, and she did to her as she had done to
the first. At the sight of this, the mind of the Khaleefeh was troubled,
and his heart was contracted, and he winked to Ja&#7841;far that he should
ask her the reason; but he replied by a sign, Speak not.</p>

<p>The mistress of the house then looked towards the portress, and
said to her, Arise to perform what thou hast to do. She replied,
Good:&mdash;and the mistress of the house seated herself upon a couch of
alabaster, overlaid with gold and silver, and said to the portress and
the cateress, Now perform your parts. The portress then seated herself
upon a couch by her; and the cateress, having entered a closet,
brought out from it a bag of satin with green fringes, and, placing
herself before the lady of the house, shook it, and took out from it a
lute; and she tuned its strings, and sang to it these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Restore to my eyelids the sleep which hath been ravished; and inform me of my reason, whither it hath fled.</span>
<span class="i0">I discovered, when I took up my abode with love, that slumber had become an enemy to my eyes.</span>
<span class="i0">They said, We saw thee to be one of the upright; what, then, hath seduced thee? I answered, Seek the cause from his glance.</span>
<span class="i0">Verily I excuse him for the shedding of my blood, admitting that I urged him to the deed by vexation.</span>
<span class="i0">He cast his sun-like image upon the mirror of my mind, and its reflection kindled a flame in my vitals.<a href="#III34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the portress<a href="#III35" class="fnanchor">35</a> had heard this song, she exclaimed, Allah
approve thee!&mdash;and she rent her clothes, and fell upon the floor in a
swoon; and when her bosom was thus uncovered, the Khaleefeh saw
upon her the marks of beating, as if from mi&#7731;ra'ahs<a href="#III36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and whips; at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
which he was greatly surprised. The cateress<a href="#III37" class="fnanchor">37</a> immediately arose,
sprinkled water upon her face, and brought her another dress, which
she put on. The Khaleefeh then said to Ja&#7841;far, Seest thou not this
woman, and the marks of beating upon her? I cannot keep silence
respecting this affair, nor be at rest, until I know the truth of the
history of this damsel, and that of these two bitches. But Ja&#7841;far
replied, O our lord, they have made a covenant with us that we shall
not speak excepting of that which concerneth us, lest we hear that
which will not please us.&mdash;The cateress then took the lute again, and,
placing it against her bosom, touched the chords with the ends of her
fingers, and thus sang to it:&mdash;</p>

<p>On hearing these verses of the cateress, the portress again rent her
clothes, and cried out, and fell upon the floor in a swoon; and the
cateress, as before, put on her another dress, after she had sprinkled
some water upon her face.<a href="#III39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The mendicants, when they witnessed this scene, said, Would that
we had never entered this house, but rather had passed the night upon
the mounds;<a href="#III40" class="fnanchor">40</a> for our night hath been rendered foul by an event that
breaketh the back! The Khaleefeh, looking towards them, then said,
Wherefore is it so with you? They answered, Our hearts are troubled
by this occurrence.&mdash;Are ye not, he asked, of this house?&mdash;No, they
answered; nor did we imagine that this house belonged to any but the
man who is sitting with you:&mdash;upon which the porter said, Verily, I
have never seen this place before this night; and I would that I had
passed the night upon the mounds rather than here. They then
observed, one to another, We are seven men, and they are but three
women; we will, therefore, ask them of their history; and if they
answer us not willingly they shall do it in spite of themselves:&mdash;and
they all agreed to this, excepting Ja&#7841;far, who said, This is not a right
determination; leave them to themselves, for we are their guests, and
they made a covenant with us which we should fulfil: there remaineth
but little of the night, and each of us shall soon go his way. Then,
winking to the Khaleefeh, he said, There remaineth but an hour; and
to-morrow we will bring them before thee, and thou shalt ask them
their story. But the Khaleefeh refused to do so, and said, I have not
patience to wait so long for their history.&mdash;Words followed words,
and at last they said, Who shall put the question to them?&mdash;and one
answered, The porter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px; position: relative;"><a name="f61" id="f61"></a><img src="images/fig61.png" width="300" height="404" alt="The Porter seized" title="The Porter seized" /></div>

<p>The ladies then said to them, O people, of what are ye talking?&mdash;whereupon
the porter approached the mistress of the house, and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
to her, O my mistress, I ask thee, and conjure thee by Allah, to tell us
the story of the two bitches, and for what reason thou didst beat them,
and then didst weep, and kiss them, and that thou acquaint us with the
cause of thy sister's having been beaten with mi&#7731;ra'ahs: that is our
question, and peace be on you.&mdash;Is this true that he saith of you?
inquired the lady, of the other men; and they all answered, Yes,&mdash;excepting
Ja&#7841;far, who was silent. When the lady heard their answer,
she said, Verily, O our guests, ye have wronged us excessively; for we
made a covenant with you beforehand, that he who should speak of
that which concerned him not should hear that which would not please
him. Is it not enough that we have admitted you into our house, and
fed you with our provisions? But it is not so much your fault as the
fault of her who introduced you to us.&mdash;She then tucked up her sleeve
above her wrist, and struck the floor three times, saying, Come ye
quickly!&mdash;and immediately the door of a closet opened, and there
came forth from it seven black slaves, each having in his hand a drawn
sword. The lady said to them, Tie behind them the hands of these
men of many words, and bind each of them to another:&mdash;and they
did so, and said, O virtuous lady, dost thou permit us to strike off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
their heads? She answered, Give them a short respite, until I shall
have inquired of them their histories, before ye behead them.&mdash;By
Allah, O my mistress, exclaimed the porter, kill me not for the offence
of others: for they have all transgressed and committed an offence,
excepting me. Verily our night had been pleasant if we had been
preserved from these mendicants, whose presence is enough to convert
a well-peopled city into a heap of ruins!&mdash;He then repeated this
couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How good is it to pardon one able to resist! and how much more so, one who is helpless!</span>
<span class="i0">For the sake of the friendship that subsisted between us, destroy not one for the crime of another!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>On hearing these words of the porter, the lady laughed after her
anger. Then approaching the men, she said, Acquaint me with your
histories, for there remaineth of your lives no more than an hour.
Were ye not persons of honourable and high condition, or
governors,<a href="#III41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
I would hasten your recompense.&mdash;The Khaleefeh said to Ja&#7841;far, Wo
to thee, O Ja&#7841;far! make known to her who we are; otherwise she will
kill us.&mdash;It were what we deserve, replied he.&mdash;Jesting, said the
Khaleefeh, is not befitting in a time for seriousness: each has its
proper occasion.&mdash;The lady then approached the mendicants, and said
to them, Are ye brothers? They answered, No, indeed; we are only
poor foreigners.<a href="#III42" class="fnanchor">42</a> She said then to one of them, Wast thou born blind
of one eye?&mdash;No, verily, he answered; but a wonderful event happened
to me when my eye was destroyed, and the story of it, if
engraved on the understanding, would serve as a lesson to him who
would be admonished. She asked the second and the third also;
and they answered her as the first; adding, Each of us is from a
different country, and our history is wonderful and extraordinary.
The lady then looked towards them and said, Each of you shall relate
his story, and the cause of his coming to our abode, and then stroke
his head,<a href="#III43" class="fnanchor">43</a> and go his way.</p>

<p>The first who advanced was the porter, who said, O my mistress, I
am a porter; and this cateress loaded me, and brought me hither, and
what hath happened to me here in your company ye know. This is
my story; and peace be on you.&mdash;Stroke thy head, then, said she,
and go:&mdash;but he replied, By Allah, I will not go until I shall have
heard the story of my companions.&mdash;The first mendicant then
advanced, and related as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE FIRST ROYAL MENDICANT.</h5>

<p>Know, O my mistress, that the cause of my having shaved my
beard, and of the loss of my eye was this:&mdash;My father was a King, and
he had a brother who was also a King, and who resided in another
capital. It happened that my mother gave birth to me on the same
day on which the son of my uncle was born; and years and days
passed away until we attained to manhood. Now, it was my custom,
some years, to visit my uncle, and to remain with him several months;
and on one of these occasions my cousin paid me great honour; he
slaughtered sheep for me, and strained the wine for me, and we sat
down to drink; and when the wine had affected us, he said to me, O
son of my uncle, I have need of thine assistance in an affair of interest
to me, and I beg that thou wilt not oppose me in that which I desire
to do. I replied, I am altogether at thy service:&mdash;and he made me
swear to him by great oaths, and, rising immediately, absented himself
for a little while, and then returned, followed by a woman decked with
ornaments, and perfumed, and wearing a dress of extraordinary value.
He looked towards me, while the woman stood behind him, and said,
Take this woman, and go before me to the burial-ground which is in
such a place:&mdash;and he described it to me, and I knew it. He then
added, Enter the burial-ground, and there wait for me.</p>

<p>I could not oppose him, nor refuse to comply with his request, on
account of the oaths which I had sworn to him; so I took the woman,
and went with her to the burial-ground; and when we had sat there
a short time, my cousin came, bearing a basin of water, and a bag
containing some plaster, and a small adze. Going to a tomb in the
midst of the burial-ground, he took the adze, and disunited the stones,
which he placed on one side; he then dug up the earth with the adze,
and uncovered a flat stone, of the size of a small door, under which
there appeared a vaulted staircase. Having done this he made a
sign to the woman, and said to her, Do according to thy choice:&mdash;whereupon
she descended the stairs. He then looked towards me,
and said, O son of my uncle, complete thy kindness when I have
descended into this place, by replacing the trap-door and the earth
above it as they were before: then, this plaster which is in the bag,
and this water which is in the basin, do thou knead together, and
plaster the stones of the tomb as they were, so that no man may know
it, and say, This hath been lately opened, but its interior is old:&mdash;for,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
during the space of a whole year I have been preparing this, and no
one knew it but God: this is what I would have thee do. He then
said to me, May God never deprive thy friends of thy presence, O son
of my uncle!&mdash;and, having uttered these words, he descended the
stairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="f62" id="f62"></a><img src="images/fig62.png" width="550" height="550" alt="First Prince (afterwards a Mendicant) leading the Lady to the Tomb" title="First Prince (afterwards a Mendicant) leading the Lady to the Tomb" /></div>

<p>When he had disappeared from before my eyes, I replaced the
trap-door, and busied myself with doing as he had ordered me, until
the tomb was restored to the state in which it was at first; after which
I returned to the palace of my uncle, who was then absent on a hunting
excursion. I slept that night, and when the morning came, I
reflected upon what had occurred between me and my cousin, and
repented of what I had done for him, when repentance was of no avail.
I then went out to the burial-ground, and searched for the tomb; but
could not discover it. I ceased not in my search until the approach
of night; and, not finding the way to it, returned again to the palace;
and I neither ate nor drank: my heart was troubled respecting my
cousin, since I knew not what had become of him; and I fell into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
excessive grief. I passed the night sorrowful until the morning, and
went again to the burial-ground, reflecting upon the action of my
cousin, and repenting of my compliance with his request; and I
searched among all the tombs; but discovered not that for which
I looked. Thus I persevered in my search seven days without
success.<a href="#III44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>My trouble continued and increased until I was almost mad; and
I found no relief but in departing, and returning to my father; but
on my arrival at his capital, a party at the city-gate sprang upon me
and bound me. I was struck with the utmost astonishment, considering
that I was the son of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of the city, and that these were
the servants of my father and of myself: excessive fear of them overcame
me, and I said within myself, What hath happened to my
father? I asked, of those who had bound me, the cause of this
conduct; but they returned me no answer, till after a while, when one
of them, who had been my servant, said to me, Fortune hath betrayed
thy father, the troops have been false to him, and the Wezeer hath
killed him; and we were lying in wait to take thee.&mdash;They took me,
and I was as one dead, by reason of this news which I had heard
respecting my father; and I stood before the Wezeer who had killed
my father.</p>

<p>Now, there was an old enmity subsisting between me and him;
and the cause of it was this:&mdash;I was fond of shooting with the cross-bow;
and it happened, one day, that as I was standing on the roof of
my palace, a bird alighted on the roof of the palace of the Wezeer,
who was standing there at the time, and I aimed at the bird; but the
bullet missed it, and struck the eye of the Wezeer, and knocked it
out, in accordance with the appointment of fate and destiny, as the
poet hath said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We trod the steps appointed for us: and the man whose steps are appointed must tread them.</span>
<span class="i0">He whose death is decreed to take place in one land will not die in any land but that.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When I had thus put out the eye of the Wezeer, he could say nothing,
because my father was King of the city. This was the cause of the
enmity between him and me: and when I stood before him, with my
hands bound behind me, he gave the order to strike off my head. I
said to him, Wouldst thou kill me for no offence?&mdash;What offence, he
exclaimed, could be greater than this?&mdash;and he pointed to the place
of the eye which was put out. I did that, said I, unintentionally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
He replied, If thou didst it unintentionally, I will do the same to thee
purposely:&mdash;and immediately he said, Bring him forward to me:&mdash;and,
when they had done so, he thrust his finger into my left eye, and
pulled it out. Thus I became deprived of one eye, as ye see me. He
then bound me firmly, and placed me in a chest, and said to the
executioner, Take this fellow, and draw thy sword, and convey him
without the city; then put him to death, and let the wild beasts
devour him.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he went forth with me from the city, and, having
taken me out from the chest, bound hand and foot, was about to
bandage my eye, and kill me; whereupon I wept, and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How many brothers have I taken as armour! and such they were; but to guard my enemies.</span>
<span class="i0">I thought they would be as piercing arrows: and such they were; but to enter my heart!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The executioner, who had served my father in the same capacity,
and to whom I had shewn kindnesses, said, on hearing these verses,
O my master, what can I do, being a slave under command?&mdash;but
presently he added, Depart with thy life, and return not to this
country, lest thou perish, and cause me to perish with thee. The
poet saith,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flee with thy life if thou fearest oppression, and leave the house to tell its builder's fate.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt find, for the land that thou quittest, another: but no soul wilt thou find to replace thine own.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As soon as he had thus said, I kissed his hands, and believed not
in my safety until I had fled from his presence. The loss of my eye
appeared light to me when I considered my escape from death; and
I journeyed to my uncle's capital, and, presenting myself before him,
informed him of what had befallen my father, and of the manner in
which I had lost my eye: upon which he wept bitterly, and said, Thou
hast added to my trouble and my grief; for thy cousin hath been lost
for some days, and I know not what hath happened to him, nor can
any one give me information respecting him. Then he wept again,
until he became insensible; and when he recovered, he said, O my
son, the loss of thine eye is better than the loss of thy life.</p>

<p>Upon this I could no longer keep silence respecting his son, my
cousin; so I informed him of all that happened to him; and on
hearing this news he rejoiced exceedingly, and said, Shew me the
tomb.&mdash;By Allah, O my uncle, I replied, I know not where it is; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
I went afterwards several times to search for it, and could not recognise
its place. We, however, went together to the burial-ground, and,
looking to the right and left, I discovered it; and both I and my
uncle rejoiced. I then entered the tomb with him, and when we had
removed the earth, and lifted up the trap-door, we descended fifty
steps, and, arriving at the bottom of the stairs, there issued forth upon
us a smoke which blinded our eyes; whereupon my uncle pronounced
those words which relieve from fear him who uttereth them,&mdash;There is
no strength nor power but in God, the High, the Great!&mdash;After this,
we proceeded, and found ourselves in a saloon, filled with flour and
grain, and various eatables; and we saw there a curtain suspended
over a couch, upon which my uncle looked, and found there his son
and the woman who had descended with him, lying side by side, and
converted into black charcoal, as if they had been thrown into a pit of
fire. And when he beheld this spectacle, he spat in his son's face,
and exclaimed, This is what thou deservest, O thou wretch! This is
the punishment of the present world, and there remaineth the punishment
of the other world, which will be more severe and lasting!&mdash;and
he struck him with his shoes. Astonished at this action, and grieved
for my cousin, seeing him and the damsel thus converted into charcoal,
I said, By Allah, O my uncle, moderate the trouble of thy heart,
for my mind is perplexed by that which hath happened to thy son,
and by thinking how it hath come to pass that he and the damsel are
converted into black charcoal. Dost thou not deem it enough for him
to be in this state, that thou beatest him with thy shoes?</p>

<p>O son of my brother, he replied, this my son was, from his early
years, inflamed with love for his foster-sister,<a href="#III45" class="fnanchor">45</a> and I used to forbid
him from entertaining this passion for her, and to say within myself,
They are now children, but when they grow older a base act will be
committed by them:&mdash;and, indeed, I heard that such had been the
case, but I believed it not. I, however, reprimanded him severely,
and said to him, Beware of so foul an action, which none before thee
hath committed, nor will any commit after thee: otherwise we shall
suffer disgrace and disparagement among the Kings until we die, and
our history will spread abroad with the caravans: have a care for thyself
that such an action proceed not from thee; for I should be incensed
against thee, and kill thee. I then separated him from her, and her
from him: but the vile woman loved him excessively; the Devil got
possession of them both; and when my son saw that I had separated
him, he secretly made this place beneath the earth, and, having con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>veyed
hither the provisions which thou seest, took advantage of my
inadvertence when I had gone out to hunt, and came hither: but the
Truth<a href="#III46" class="fnanchor">46</a> (whose perfection be extolled, and whose name be exalted!)
was jealously vigilant over them, and consumed them by fire; and the
punishment of the world to come will be more severe and lasting.&mdash;He
then wept, and I wept with him; and he said to me, Thou art my
son in his stead.&mdash;I remained a while reflecting upon the world and its
vicissitudes, upon the murder of my father by the Wezeer, and his
usurping his throne, and the loss of my eye, and the strange events
which had happened to my cousin, and I wept again.</p>

<p>We then ascended, and, having replaced the trap-door and the
earth above it, and restored the tomb to its former state, returned to
our abode; but scarcely had we seated ourselves when we heard the
sounds of drums and trumpets, warriours galloped about, and the air
was filled with dust raised by the horses' hoofs. Our minds were
perplexed, not knowing what had happened, and the King, asking
the news, was answered, The Wezeer of thy brother hath slain him
and his soldiers and guards, and come with his army to assault the
city unawares; and the inhabitants, being unable to withstand, have
submitted to him:&mdash;whereupon I said within myself, If I fall into his
hand, he will slay me.&mdash;Griefs overwhelmed me, and I thought of the
calamities which had befallen my father and my mother, and knew not
what to do; for if I appeared, the people of the city would know me,
and the troops of my father would hasten to kill and destroy me. I
knew no way of escape but to shave off my beard:<a href="#III47" class="fnanchor">47</a> so I shaved it, and,
having changed my clothes, departed from the city, and came hither,
to this abode of peace, in the hope that some person would introduce
me to the Prince of the Faithful, the Khaleefeh of the Lord of all
creatures, that I might relate to him my story, and all that had befallen
me. I arrived in this city this night; and as I stood perplexed, not
knowing whither to direct my steps, I saw this mendicant, and saluted
him, and said, I am a stranger. He replied, And I, too, am a
stranger:&mdash;and while we were thus addressing each other, our companion,
this third person, came up to us, and saluting us, said, I am
a stranger. We replied, And we, also, are strangers. So we walked
on together, and darkness overtook us, and destiny directed us unto
your abode.&mdash;This was the cause of the shaving of my beard, and of
the loss of my eye.</p>

<p>The lady then said to him, Stroke my head, and depart:&mdash;but he
replied, I will not depart until I have heard the stories of the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
And they wondered at his tale; and the Khaleefeh said to Ja&#7841;far,
Verily I have never known the like of that which hath happened to
this mendicant.</p>

<p>The second mendicant then advanced, and, having kissed the
ground, said,&mdash;</p>

<hr />
<h5>THE STORY OF THE SECOND ROYAL MENDICANT.</h5>

<p>O my mistress, I was not born with only one eye; but my story is
wonderful, and, if written, would serve as a lesson to him who would
be admonished. I am a King, and son of a King: I read the &#7730;ur&aacute;n
according to the seven readings,<a href="#III48" class="fnanchor">48</a> and perused various works under
the tuition of different learned professors of their subjects: I studied
the science of the stars,<a href="#III49" class="fnanchor">49</a> and the writings of the poets, and made
myself a proficient in all the sciences; so that I surpassed the people
of my age. My hand-writing<a href="#III50" class="fnanchor">50</a> was extolled among all the scribes, my
fame spread among all countries, and my history among all Kings;
and the King of India, hearing of me, requested my father to allow
me to visit him, sending him various gifts and curious presents, such
as were suitable to Kings. My father, therefore, prepared for me six
ships, and we proceeded by sea for the space of a whole month, after
which we came to land; and, having disembarked some horses which
we had with us in the ship, we loaded ten camels with presents, and
commenced our journey; but soon there appeared a cloud of dust,
which rose and spread until it filled the air before us, and, after a
while, cleared a little, and discovered to us, in the midst of it, sixty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
horseman like fierce lions whom we perceived to be Arab highwaymen;
and when they saw us, that we were a small company with ten loads
of presents for the King of India, they galloped towards us, pointing
their spears at us. We made signs to them with our fingers, and
said, We are ambassadors to the honoured King of India; therefore
do us no injury:&mdash;but they replied, We are not in his territories, nor
under his government. They slew certain of the young men, and the
rest fled. I also fled, after I had received a severe wound; the Arabs
being employed, without further regard to us, in taking possession of
the treasure and presents which we had with us.</p>

<p>I proceeded without knowing whither to direct my course, reduced
from a mighty to an abject state, and journeyed till I arrived at the
summit of a mountain, where I took shelter in a cavern until the next
morning. I then resumed my journey, and arrived at a flourishing
city: the winter, with its cold, had passed away, and the spring had
come, with its flowers; and I rejoiced at my arrival there, being
wearied with my journey, anxious and pallid. My condition being
thus changed, I knew not whither to bend my steps; and, turning to
a tailor sitting in his shop, I saluted him, and he returned my salutation,
and welcomed me, and wished me joy, asking me the reason of
my having come thither. I acquainted him, therefore, with what had
befallen me from first to last, and he was grieved for me, and said, O
young man, reveal not thy case, for I fear what the King of this city
might do to thee, since he is the greatest of thy father's enemies, and
hath a debt of blood against him. He then placed some food and
drink before me, and we ate together, and I conversed with him till
night, when he lodged me in a place by his shop, and brought me a
bed and coverlet; and, after I had remained with him three days, he
said to me, Dost thou not know any trade by which to make gain?<a href="#III51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
I answered, I am acquainted with the law, a student of sciences, a
writer, and an arithmetician.&mdash;Thy occupation, he said, is profitless in
our country: there is no one in our city acquainted with science or
writing, but only with getting money. Verily, I replied, I know
nothing but what I have told thee.&mdash;Gird thyself, then, said he, and
take an axe and a rope, and cut firewood in the desert, and so obtain
thy subsistence until God dispel thy affliction; but acquaint no one
with thy history, else they will kill thee. He then bought for me an
axe and a rope, and sent me with a party of wood-cutters, giving them
a charge respecting me. Accordingly, I went forth with them, and,
cut some wood, and brought back a load upon my head, and sold it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
for half a piece of gold, part of which I expended in food, laying by
the remainder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px; position: relative;"><a name="f64" id="f64"></a><img src="images/fig064.png" width="489" height="639" alt="Second Prince as a Wood-cutter" title="Second Prince as a Wood-cutter" /></div>

<p>Thus I continued for the space of a year, after which I went one
day into the desert, according to my custom, to cut firewood; and,
finding there a tract with abundance of wood, I entered it, and came
to a tree, around which I dug; and as I was removing the earth from
its roots, the axe struck against a ring of brass; and I cleared away
the earth from it, and found that it was affixed to a trap-door of wood,
which I immediately removed. Beneath it appeared a staircase, which
I descended; and at the bottom of this I entered a door, and beheld a
palace, strongly constructed, where I found a lady, like a pearl of
high price, whose aspect banished from the heart all anxiety and grief
and affliction. At the sight of her I prostrated myself in adoration of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
her Creator for the fairness and beauty which He had displayed in her
person; and she, looking towards me, said, Art thou a man or a
Jinnee? I answered her, I am a man.&mdash;And who, she asked, hath
brought thee to this place, in which I have lived five and twenty years
without ever seeing a human being?&mdash;Her words sounded sweetly to
me, and I answered her, O my mistress, God hath brought me to thy
abode, and I hope will put an end to my anxiety and grief:&mdash;and I
related to her my story from beginning to end. She was grieved at
my case, and wept, and said, I also will acquaint thee with my story.
Know that I am the daughter of the King of the further parts of
India, the lord of the Ebony Island. My father had married me to
the son of my uncle; but on the night of my bridal festivities, an
'Efreet namad Jarjarees, the son of Rejmoos, the son of Iblees, carried
me off, and, soaring with me through the air, alighted in this place, to
which he conveyed all things necessary for me, such as ornaments, and
garments, and linen, and furniture, and food, and drink; and once in
every ten days he cometh to me, and spendeth a night here;<a href="#III52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and he
hath appointed with me, that, in case of my wanting any thing by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
night or day, I should touch with my hand these two lines which are
inscribed upon the &#7731;ubbeh,<a href="#III53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and as soon as I remove my hand I see
him before me. Four days have now passed since he was last with
me, and there remain, therefore, six days before he will come again;
wilt thou then remain with me five days, and depart one day before
his visit?&mdash;I answered, Yes; rejoicing at the proposal; and she
arose, and taking me by the hand, conducted me through an arched
door to a small and elegant bath, where I took off my clothes, while
she seated herself upon a mattress. After this, she seated me by her
side, and brought me some sherbet of sugar infused with musk,<a href="#III54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and
handed it to me to drink: she then placed some food before me, and
after we had eaten and conversed together, she said to me, Sleep, and
rest thyself; for thou art fatigued.</p>

<p>I slept, O my mistress, and forgot all that had befallen me; and
when I awoke, I found her rubbing my feet;<a href="#III55" class="fnanchor">55</a> upon which I called to
her, and we sat down again and conversed a while; and she said to me,
By Allah, I was straitened in my heart, living here alone, without any
person to talk with me, five and twenty years. Praise be to God who
hath sent thee to me.&mdash;I thanked her for her kind expressions; and
love of her took possession of my heart, and my anxiety and grief fled
away. We then sat down to drink together; and I remained by her
side all the night, delighted with her company, for I had never seen
her like in my whole life; and in the morning, when we were both
full of joy, I said to her, Shall I take thee up from this subterranean
place, and release thee from the Jinnee? But she laughed, and
replied, Be content, and hold thy peace; for, of every ten days, one
day shall be for the 'Efreet, and nine for thee. I persisted, however,
being overcome with passion: and said, I will this instant demolish
this &#7731;ubbeh upon which the inscription is engraved, and let the 'Efreet
come, that I may slay him: for I am predestined to kill 'Efreets. She
entreated me to refrain; but, paying no attention to her words, I
kicked the &#7731;ubbeh with violence; upon which she exclaimed, The
'Efreet hath arrived! Did I not caution thee against this? Verily
thou hast brought a calamity upon me; but save thyself, and ascend
by the way that thou camest.</p>

<p>In the excess of my fear I forgot my sandals and my axe, and
when I had ascended two steps, turning round to look for them, I saw
that the ground had opened, and there rose from it an 'Efreet of
hideous aspect, who said, Wherefore is this disturbance with which
thou hast alarmed me, and what misfortune hath befallen thee? She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
answered, No misfortune hath happened to me, excepting that my
heart was contracted, and I desired to drink some wine to dilate it,
and, rising to perform my purpose, I fell against the &#7731;ubbeh.&mdash;Thou
liest, vile woman, he exclaimed;&mdash;and, looking about the palace to the
right and left, he saw the sandals and axe; and said to her, These are
the property of none but a man. Who hath visited thee?&mdash;I have
not seen them, she answered, until this instant: probably they caught
to thee.&mdash;This language, said he, is absurd, and will have no effect upon
me, thou shameless woman!&mdash;and, so saying, he stripped her of her
clothing, and tied her down, with her arms and legs extended, to
four stakes, and began to beat her, urging her to confess what had
happened.</p>

<p>For myself, being unable to endure her cries, I ascended the stairs,
overpowered by fear, and, arriving at the top, replaced the trap-door
as it was at first, and covered it over with earth. I repented bitterly
of what I had done, and reflecting upon the lady and her beauty, and
how this wretch was torturing her after she had lived with him five
and twenty years, and that he tortured her only on my account, and
reflecting also upon my father and his kingdom, and how I had been
reduced to the condition of a wood-cutter, I repeated this verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When fortune bringeth thee affliction, console thyself by remembering that one day thou must see prosperity, and another day, difficulty.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Returning to my companion, the tailor, I found him awaiting my
return as if he were placed in a pan upon burning coals. I past last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
night, said he, with anxious heart on thy account, fearing for thee
from some wild beast or other calamity. Praise be to God for thy safe
return.&mdash;I thanked him for his tender concern for me, and entered
my apartment; and as I sat meditating upon that which had befallen
me, and blaming myself for having kicked the &#7731;ubbeh, my friend the
tailor came in to me, and said, In the shop is a foreigner, who asks
for thee, and he has thy axe and sandals; he came with them to the
wood-cutters,<a href="#III56" class="fnanchor">56</a> and said to them, I went out at the time of the call of
the Mu&euml;ddin to morning-prayer, and stumbled upon these, and know
not to whom they belong: can ye guide me to their owner?&mdash;The
wood-cutters, therefore, directed him to thee: he is sitting in my
shop; so go out to him and thank him, and take thy axe and thy
sandals.&mdash;On hearing these words, my countenance turned pale, and
my whole state became changed; and while I was in this condition,
the floor of my chamber clove asunder, and there rose from it the
stranger, and lo, he was the 'Efreet; he had tortured the lady with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the utmost cruelty; but she would confess nothing: so he took the
axe and the sandals, and said to her, If I am Jarjarees, of the descendants
of Iblees, I will bring the owner of this axe and these sandals.
Accordingly, he came, with the pretence before mentioned, to the
wood-cutters, and, having entered my chamber, without granting me
any delay, seized me, and soared with me through the air: he then
descended, and dived into the earth, and brought me up into the
palace where I was before.</p>

<p>Here I beheld the lady stripped of her clothing, and with blood
flowing from her sides; and tears trickled from my eyes. The 'Efreet
then took hold of her, and said, Vile woman, this is thy lover:&mdash;whereupon
she looked at me, and replied, I know him not, nor have I
ever seen him until this instant. The 'Efreet said to her, With all
this torture wilt thou not confess? She answered, Never in my life
have I seen him before, and it is not lawful in the sight of God that I
should speak falsely against him.<a href="#III57" class="fnanchor">57</a>&mdash;Then, said he, if thou know him
not, take this sword and strike off his head. She took the sword, and
came to me, and stood over my head: but I made a sign to her with
my eyebrow, while tears ran down my cheeks. She replied in a
similar manner, Thou art he who hath done all this to me:&mdash;I made a
sign to her, however, that this was a time for pardon, conveying my
meaning in the manner thus described by the poet:&mdash;<a href="#III58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our signal in love is the glance of our eyes; and every intelligent person understandeth the sign.</span>
<span class="i0">Our eyebrows carry on an intercourse between us: we are silent; but love speaketh.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when she understood me, she threw the sword from her hand, O
my mistress, and the 'Efreet handed it to me, saying, Strike off her
head, and I will liberate thee, and do thee no harm. I replied, Good:&mdash;and,
quickly approaching her, raised my hand; but she made a
sign as though she would say, I did no injury to thee:&mdash;whereupon
my eyes poured with tears, and, throwing down the sword, I said, O
mighty 'Efreet, and valiant hero, if a woman, deficient in sense and
religion,<a href="#III59" class="fnanchor">59</a> seeth it not lawful to strike off my head, how is it lawful for
me to do so to her, and especially when I have never seen her before
in my life? I will never do it, though I should drink the cup of
death and destruction.&mdash;There is affection between you, said the
'Efreet, and, taking the sword, he struck off one of the hands of the
lady; then, the other; after this, her right foot; and then, her left
foot: thus with four blows he cut off her four extremities, while I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
looked on, expecting my own death. She then made a sign to me
with her eye; and the 'Efreet, observing her, exclaimed, Now thou
hast been guilty of incontinence with thine eye!&mdash;and, with a blow of
his sword, struck off her head; after which, he turned towards me,
and said, O man, it is allowed us by our law, if a wife be guilty of
incontinence, to put her to death. This woman I carried off on her
wedding-night, when she was twelve years of age, and she was
acquainted with no man but me; and I used to pass one night with
her in the course of every ten days in the garb of a foreigner; and
when I discovered of a certainty that she had been unfaithful to me,
I killed her: but as for thee, I am not convinced that thou hast
wronged me with respect to her; yet I must not leave thee unpunished:
choose, therefore, what injury I shall do to thee.</p>

<p>Upon this, O my mistress, I rejoiced exceedingly, and, eager to
obtain his pardon, I said to him, What shall I choose from thy hands?&mdash;Choose,
he answered, into what form I shall change thee; either the
form of a dog, or that of an ass, or that of an ape. I replied, in my
desire of forgiveness, Verily, if thou wilt pardon me, God will pardon
thee in recompense for thy shewing mercy to a Muslim who hath
done thee no injury:&mdash;and I humbled myself in the most abject
manner, and said to him, Pardon me as the envied man did the envier.&mdash;And
how was that? said he. I answered as follows:&mdash;<a href="#III60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE ENVIER AND THE ENVIED.</h5>

<p>Know, O my master, that there was a certain man who had a
neighbour that envied him; and the more this person envied him, so
much the more did God increase the prosperity of the former. Thus
it continued a long time; but when the envied man found that his
neighbour persisted in troubling him, he removed to a place where
there was a deserted well; and there he built for himself an oratory,
and occupied himself in the worship of God. Numerous Fa&#7731;eers<a href="#III61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
assembled around him, and he acquired great esteem, people repairing
to him from every quarter, placing firm reliance upon his sanctity;
and his fame reached the ears of his envious neighbour, who mounted
his horse, and went to visit him; and when the envied man saw him,
he saluted him, and payed him the utmost civility. The envier then
said to him, I have come hither to inform thee of a matter in which
thou wilt find advantage, and for which I shall obtain a recompense
in heaven. The envied man replied, May God requite thee for me
with every blessing. Then, said the envier, order the Fa&#7731;eers to retire
to their cells, for the information that I am about to give thee I would
have no one overhear. So he ordered them to enter their cells; and
the envier said to him, Arise, and let us walk together, and converse;
and they walked on until they came to the deserted well before mentioned,
when the envier pushed the envied man into this well, without
the knowledge of any one, and went his way, imagining that he had
killed him.</p>

<p>But this well was inhabited by Jinn, who received him unhurt,
and seated him upon a large stone; and when they had done this, one
of them said to the others, Do ye know this man? They answered,
We know him not.&mdash;This, said he, is the envied man who fled from
him who envied him, and took up his abode in this quarter, in the
neighbouring oratory, and who entertaineth us by his zikr<a href="#III62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and his
readings; and when his envier heard of him, he came hither to him,
and, devising a stratagem against him, threw him down here. His
fame hath this night reached the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of this city, who hath purposed
to visit him to-morrow, on account of the affliction which
hath befallen his daughter.&mdash;And what, said they, hath happened to
his daughter? He answered, Madness; for Meymoon, the son of
Demdem, hath become inflamed with love for her; and her cure is
the easiest of things. They asked him, What is it?&mdash;and he answered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
The black cat that is with him in the oratory hath at the end of her
tail a white spot, of the size of a piece of silver; and from this white
spot should be taken seven hairs, and with these the damsel should
be fumigated, and the M&aacute;rid would depart from over her head, and
not return to her; so she would be instantly cured. And now it is
our duty to take him out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px; position: relative;"><a name="f69" id="f69"></a><img src="images/fig069.png" width="478" height="526" alt="The Envied Sheykh and the Jinn in the Well" title="The Envied Sheykh and the Jinn in the Well" /></div>

<p>When the morning came, the Fa&#7731;eers saw the Sheykh rising out of
the well; and he became magnified in their eyes. And when he
entered the oratory, he took from the white spot at the end of the
cat's tail seven hairs, and placed them in a portfolio by him; and at
sunrise the King came to him, and when the Sheykh saw him, he said
to him, O King, thou hast come to visit me in order that I may cure
thy daughter. The King replied. Yes, O virtuous Sheykh.&mdash;Then,
said the Sheykh, send some person to bring her hither; and I trust
in God, whose name be exalted, that she may be instantly cured.
And when the King had brought his daughter, the Sheykh beheld her
bound, and, seating her, suspended a curtain over her, and took out
the hairs, and fumigated her with them; whereupon the M&aacute;rid cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
out from over her head, and left her; and the damsel immediately
recovered her reason, and, veiling her face, said to her father, What is
this, and wherefore didst thou bring me to this place? He answered
her, Thou hast nothing to fear;&mdash;and rejoiced greatly. He kissed the
hand of the envied Sheykh, and said to the great men of his court who
were with him, What shall be the recompense of this Sheykh for that
which he hath done? They answered, His recompense should be
that thou marry him to her.&mdash;Ye have spoken truly, said the King:&mdash;and
he gave her in marriage to him, and thus the Sheykh became a
connection of the King; and after some days the King died, and he
was made King in his place.</p>

<p>And it happened one day that this envied King was riding with
his troops, and he saw his envier approaching; and when this man
came before him he seated him upon a horse with high distinction and
honour, and, taking him to his palace, gave him a thousand pieces of
gold, and a costly dress; after which he sent him back from the city,
with attendants to escort him to his house, and reproached him for
nothing.&mdash;Consider, then, O 'Efreet, the pardon of the envied to the
envier, and his kindness to him, notwithstanding the injuries he had
done him.<a href="#III63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<hr />
<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF THE SECOND ROYAL
MENDICANT.</h5>

<p>The 'Efreet, when he had heard this story, replied, Lengthen not
thy words to me: as to my killing thee, fear it not; and as to my
pardoning thee, covet it not; but as to my enchanting thee, there is
no escape from it;&mdash;and, so saying, he clove the earth asunder, and
soared with me through the sky to such a height that I beheld the
world beneath me as though it were a bowl of water: then, alighting
upon a mountain, he took up a little dust, and, having muttered and
pronounced certain words over it, sprinkled me with it, saying, Quit
this form, and take the form of an ape!&mdash;whereupon I became like an
ape of a hundred years of age.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 529px; position: relative;"><a name="f70" id="f70"></a><img src="images/fig070.png" width="529" height="662" alt="Second Prince transformed into an Ape" title="Second Prince transformed into an Ape" /></div>

<p>When I saw myself changed into this ugly form, I wept for myself,
but determined to be patient under the tyranny of fortune, knowing
it to be constant to no one. I descended from the summit of the
mountain, and, after having journeyed for the space of a month,
arrived at the sea-shore; and, when I had stood there a short time, I
saw a vessel in the midst of the sea, with a favourable wind approaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the land; I therefore hid myself behind a rock on the beach, and
when the ship came close up, I sprang into the midst of it. But as
soon as the persons on board saw me, one of them cried, Turn out
this unlucky brute from the ship:&mdash;another said, Let us kill him:&mdash;and
a third exclaimed, I will kill him with this sword. I, however,
caught hold of the end of the sword, and tears flowed from my eyes;
at the sight of which the captain took compassion on me, and said to
the passengers, O merchants, this ape hath sought my aid, and I give
it him; he is under my protection; let no one, therefore, oppose or
trouble him. He then treated me with kindness, and whatever he
said to me I understood, and all that he required to be done I performed
as his servant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>We continued our voyage for fifty days with a fair wind, and cast
anchor under a large city containing a population which no one but
God, whose name be exalted, could reckon; and when we had moored
our vessel, there came to us some memlooks from the King of the
city, who came on board the ship, and complimented the merchants
on their safe arrival, saying, Our King greeteth you, rejoicing in your
safety, and hath sent to you this roll of paper, desiring that each of
you shall write a line upon it; for the King had a Wezeer who was an
eminent caligraphist, and he is dead, and the King hath sworn that
he will not appoint any person to his office who cannot write equally
well.<a href="#III64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Though in the form of an ape, I arose and snatched the paper
from their hands; upon which, fearing that I would tear it and throw
it into the sea, they cried out against me, and would have killed me;
but I made signs to them that I would write, and the captain said to
them, Suffer him to write, and if he scribble we will turn him away;
but if he write well I will adopt him as my son; for I have never seen
a more intelligent ape. So I took the pen, and demanded the ink,
and wrote in an epistolary hand this couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fame hath recorded the virtues of the noble; but no one hath been able to reckon thine.</span>
<span class="i0">May God not deprive mankind of such a father; for thou art the parent of every excellence.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, in a more formal, large hand, I wrote the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is no writer that shall not perish; but what his hand hath written endureth ever.</span>
<span class="i0">Write, therefore, nothing but what will please thee when thou shalt see it on the day of resurrection.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Two other specimens I wrote, in two different and smaller hands, and
returned the paper to the memlooks, who took it back to the King;
and when he saw what was written upon it, the hand of no one
pleased him excepting mine; and he said to his attendants, Go to the
author of this hand-writing, put upon him this dress, and mount him
upon a mule, and conduct him, with the band of music before him, to
my presence. On hearing this order, they smiled; and the King was
angry with them, and said, How is it that I give you an order, and ye
laugh at me? They answered, O King, we laugh not at thy words,
but because he who wrote this is an ape, and not a son of Adam: he
is with the captain of the ship newly arrived.</p>

<p>The King was astonished at their words; he shook with delight,
and said, I would purchase this ape. He then sent some messengers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
to the ship, with the mule and the dress of honour, saying to them,
Ye must clothe him with this dress, and mount him upon the mule, and
bring him hither. So they came to the ship, and, taking me from the
captain, clad me with the dress; and the people were astonished, and
flocked to amuse themselves with the sight of me. And when they
brought me to the King, and I beheld him, I kissed the ground
before him three times, and he ordered me to sit down: so I sat down
upon my knees;<a href="#III65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and the persons present were surprised at my polite
manners, and especially the King, who presently ordered his people to
retire. They, therefore, did so; none remaining but the King, and a
eunuch, and a young memlook, and myself. The King then commanded
that a repast should be brought; and they placed before him
a service of viands, such as gratified the appetite and delighted the
eye; and the King made a sign to me that I should eat; whereupon
I arose, and, having kissed the ground before him seven times, sat
down to eat with him; and when the table was removed, I washed
my hands, and, taking the ink-case, and pen and paper, I wrote these
two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great is my appetite for thee, O Kun&aacute;feh!<a href="#III66" class="fnanchor">66</a> I cannot be happy nor endure without thee.</span>
<span class="i0">Be thou every day and night my food; and may drops of honey not be wanting to moisten thee.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having done this, I arose, and seated myself at a distance; and the
King, looking at what I had written, read it with astonishment, and
exclaimed, Can an ape possess such fluency and such skill in caligraphy?
This is, indeed, a wonder of wonders!&mdash;Afterwards, a chess-table was
brought to the King, and he said to me, Wilt thou play? By a
motion of my head I answered, Yes:&mdash;and I advanced, and arranged
the pieces.<a href="#III67" class="fnanchor">67</a> I played with him twice, and beat him; and the King
was perplexed, and said, Were this a man, he would surpass all the
people of his age.</p>

<p>He then said to his eunuch, Go to thy mistress, and say to her,
Answer the summons of the King:&mdash;that she may come and gratify
her curiosity by the sight of this wonderful ape. The eunuch, therefore,
went, and returned with his mistress, the King's daughter, who,
as soon as she saw me, veiled her face, and said, O my father, how is
it that thou art pleased to send for me, and suffer strange men to see
me?&mdash;O my daughter, answered the King, there is no one here but
the young memlook, and the eunuch who brought thee up, and this
ape, with myself, thy father: from whom, then, dost thou veil thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
face?&mdash;This ape, said she, is the son of a King, and the name of his
father is Eym&aacute;r:<a href="#III68" class="fnanchor">68</a> he is enchanted, and it was the 'Efreet Jarjarees, a
descendant of Iblees, who transformed him, after having slain his own
wife, the daughter of King A&#7731;n&aacute;moos. This, whom thou supposedst
to be an ape, is a learned and wise man.&mdash;The King was amazed at
his daughter's words, and, looking towards me, said, Is it true that
she saith of thee? I answered, by a motion of my head, Yes:&mdash;and
wept. The King then said to his daughter, By what means didst
thou discover that he was enchanted?&mdash;O my father, she answered, I
had with me, in my younger years, an old woman who was a cunning
enchantress, and she taught me the art of enchantment: I have committed
its rules to memory, and know it thoroughly, being acquainted
with a hundred and seventy modes of performing it, by the least of
which I could transport the stones of thy city beyond Mount &#7730;&aacute;f, and
make its site to be an abyss of the sea, and convert its inhabitants
into fish in the midst of it.&mdash;I conjure thee, then, by the name of
Allah, said her father, to restore this young man, that I may make
him my Wezeer. Is it possible that thou possessedst this excellence,
and I knew it not? Restore him, that I may make him my Wezeer,
for he is a polite and intelligent youth.</p>

<p>She replied, With pleasure:&mdash;and, taking a knife upon which
were engraved some Hebrew names, marked with it a circle in the
midst of the palace. Within this she wrote certain names and talismans,
and then she pronounced invocations, and uttered unintelligible
words; and soon the palace around us became immersed in gloom to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>

<span class="figleft3" style="width: 311px; position: relative;"><a name="f72a" id="f72a"></a><img src="images/fig072a.png" width="311" height="445" alt="The Combat with the Lion (Head-piece)" title="The Combat with the Lion (Head-piece)" /></span>

such a degree, that we
thought the whole world
was overspread; and lo,
the 'Efreet appeared before
us in a most hideous shape,
with hands like winnowing-forks,
and legs like
masts, and eyes like burning
torches; so that we
were terrified at him. The
King's daughter exclaimed,
No welcome to thee!&mdash;to
which the 'Efreet, assuming
the form of a lion,
replied, Thou traitress, how
is it that thou hast broken
thine oath? Did we not
swear that we would not
oppose one another?&mdash;Thou
wretch, said she,
when didst thou receive
an oath?&mdash;The 'Efreet, still in the form of a
lion, then exclaimed, Take what awaiteth thee!&mdash;and,
opening his mouth, rushed upon the
lady: but she instantly plucked a hair from
her head and muttered with her lips, whereupon
the hair became converted into a piercing
sword, with which she struck the lion, and
he was cleft in twain by the blow; but his
head became changed into a scorpion. The
lady immediately transformed herself into an
enormous serpent, and crept after the execrable
wretch in the shape of a scorpion, and a sharp
contest ensued between them; after which,
the scorpion became an eagle, and the serpent,
changing to a vulture, pursued the
eagle for a length of time. The latter then
transformed himself into a black cat, and
the King's daughter became a wolf, and they
fought together long and fiercely, till the
cat, seeing himself overcome, changed himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>

<span class="figright3" style="width: 197px; position: relative;"><a name="f73" id="f73"></a><img src="images/fig073.png" width="197" height="908" alt="Transformations" title="Transformations" /></span>

into a large red pomegranate, which fell
into a pool; but, the wolf pursuing it, it
ascended into the air, and then fell upon the
pavement of the palace, and broke in pieces,
its grains becoming scattered, each apart from
the others, and all spread about the whole
space of ground enclosed by the palace. The
wolf, upon this, transformed itself into a cock,
in order to pick up the grains, and not leave
one of them; but, according to the decree
of fate, one grain remained hidden by the
side of the pool of the fountain. The cock
began to cry, and flapped its wings, and
made a sign to us with its beak; but we understood
not what it would say. It then
uttered at us such a cry, that we thought
the palace had fallen down upon us; and
it ran about the whole of the ground, until it
saw the grain that had lain hid by the side
of the pool, when it pounced upon it, to pick
it up; but it fell into the midst of the water,
and became transformed into a fish, and sank
into the water; upon which the cock became
a fish of a larger size, and plunged in after
the other. For a while it was absent from
our sight; but, at length, we heard a loud
cry, and trembled at the sound; after which,
the 'Efreet rose as a flame of fire, casting
fire from his mouth, and fire and smoke from
his eyes and nostrils: the King's daughter
also became as a vast body of fire; and we
would have plunged into the water from fear
of our being burnt and destroyed; but suddenly
the 'Efreet cried out from within the
fire, and came towards us upon the leew&aacute;n,<a href="#III69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
blowing fire at our faces. The lady, however,
overtook him, and blew fire in like manner
in his face; and some sparks struck us
both from her and from him: her sparks did
us no harm; but one from him struck me in
my eye, and destroyed it, I being still in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
form of an ape; and a spark from him reached the face of the King,
and burned the lower half, with his beard and mouth, and struck
out his lower teeth: another spark also fell upon the breast of the
eunuch; who was burnt, and died immediately. We expected
destruction, and gave up all hope of preserving our lives; but
while we were in this state, a voice exclaimed, God is most great!
God is most great! He hath conquered and aided, and abandoned
the denier of the faith of Mo&#7717;ammad, the chief of mankind!<a href="#III70" class="fnanchor">70</a>&mdash;The
person from whom this voice proceeded was the King's daughter:
she had burnt the 'Efreet; and when we looked towards him, we
perceived that he had become a heap of ashes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px; position: relative;"><a name="f74" id="f74"></a><img src="images/fig074.png" width="480" height="573" alt="Disenchantment of the Ape" title="Disenchantment of the Ape" /></div>

<p>The lady then came to us, and said, Bring me a cup of water:&mdash;and
when it was brought to her, she pronounced over it some words
which we understood not, and, sprinkling me with it, said, Be restored,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
by virtue of the name of the Truth, and by virtue of the most great
name of God, to thy original form!&mdash;whereupon I became a man as I
was at first, excepting that my eye was destroyed. After this, she
cried out, The fire! the fire! O my father, I shall no longer live, for
I am predestined to be killed. Had he been a human being, I had
killed him at the first of the encounter. I experienced no difficulty
till the scattering of the grains of the pomegranate, when I picked
them up excepting the one in which was the life of the Jinnee: had I
picked up that, he had instantly died; but I saw it not, as fate and
destiny had appointed; and suddenly he came upon me, and a fierce
contest ensued between us under the earth, and in the air, and in the
water; and every time that he tried against me a new mode, I employed
against him one more potent, until he tried against me the
mode of fire; and rarely does one escape against whom the mode of
fire is employed. Destiny, however, aided me, so that I burned him
first; but I exhorted him previously to embrace the faith of El-Isl&aacute;m.
Now I die; and may God supply my place to you.&mdash;Having thus
said, she ceased not to pray for relief from the fire; and lo, a spark
ascended to her breast, and thence to her face; and when it reached
her face, she wept, and exclaimed, I testify that there is no deity but
God, and I testify that Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle!&mdash;We then
looked towards her, and saw that she had become a heap of ashes by
the side of the ashes of the 'Efreet.</p>

<p>We were plunged into grief on her account, and I wished that I had
been in her place rather than have seen that sweet-faced creature who
had done me this kindness reduced to a heap of ashes: but the decree
of God cannot be averted. The King, on beholding his daughter in
this state, plucked out what remained of his beard, and slapped his
face, and rent his clothes; and I also did the same, while we both
wept for her. Then came the chamberlains and other great officers of
the court, who, finding the King in a state of insensibility, with two
heaps of ashes before him, were astonished, and remained encompassing
him until he recovered from his fit, when he informed them of what
had befallen his daughter with the 'Efreet; and great was their affliction.
The women shrieked, with the female slaves, and continued
their mourning seven days. After this, the King gave orders to build,
over the ashes of his daughter, a great tomb with a dome, and illuminated
it with candles and lamps: but the ashes of the 'Efreet they
scattered in the wind, exposing them to the curse of God. The King
then fell sick, and was near unto death: his illness lasted a month;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
but after this he recovered his health, and, summoning me to his
presence, said to me, O young man, we passed our days in the enjoyment
of the utmost happiness, secure from the vicissitudes of fortune,
until thou camest to us, when troubles overcame us. Would that we
had never seen thee, nor thy ugly form, on account of which we have
been reduced to this state of privation: for, in the first place, I have
lost my daughter, who was worth a hundred men; and, secondly, I
have suffered this burning, and lost my teeth: my eunuch also is
dead: but it was not in thy power to prevent these afflictions: the
decree of God hath been fulfilled on us and on thee; and praise be to
God that my daughter restored thee, though she destroyed herself.
Now, however, depart, O my son, from my city. It is enough that
hath happened on thy account; but as it was decreed against us and
thee, depart in peace.</p>

<p>So I departed, O my mistress, from his presence; but before I
quitted the city, I entered a public bath, and shaved my beard. I
traversed various regions, and passed through great cities, and bent
my course to the Abode of Peace,<a href="#III71" class="fnanchor">71</a> Baghd&aacute;d, in the hope of obtaining
an interview with the Prince of the Faithful, that I might relate to
him all that had befallen me.</p>

<p>The third mendicant then advanced, and thus related his story:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE THIRD ROYAL MENDICANT.</h5>

<p>O illustrious lady, my story is not like those of my two companions,
but more wonderful: the course of fate and destiny brought
upon them events against which they could not guard; but as to myself,
the shaving of my beard and the loss of my eye were occasioned
by my provoking fate and misfortune; and the cause was this:&mdash;</p>

<p>I was a King, and the son of a King; and when my father died, I
succeeded to his throne, and governed my subjects with justice and
beneficence. I took pleasure in sea-voyages; and my capital was on
the shore of an extensive sea, interspersed with fortified and garrisoned
islands, which I desired, for my amusement, to visit; I therefore
embarked with a fleet of ten ships, and took with me provisions
sufficient for a whole month. I proceeded twenty days, after which
there arose against us a contrary wind; but at daybreak it ceased,
and the sea became calm, and we arrived at an island, where we landed,
and cooked some provisions and ate; after which we remained there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
two days. We then continued our voyage; and when twenty days
more had passed, we found ourselves in strange waters, unknown to
the captain, and desired the watch to look out from the mast-head:
so he went aloft, and when he had come down he said to the captain,
I saw, on my right hand, fish floating upon the surface of the water;
and looking towards the midst of the sea, I perceived something
looming in the distance, sometimes black, and sometimes white.</p>

<p>When the captain heard this report of the watch, he threw his
turban on the deck, and plucked his beard, and said to those who
were with him, Receive warning of our destruction, which will befall
all of us: not one will escape! So saying, he began to weep; and
all of us in like manner bewailed our lot. I desired him to inform us
of that which the watch had seen. O my lord, he replied, know that
we have wandered from our course since the commencement of the
contrary wind that was followed in the morning by a calm, in consequence
of which we remained stationary two days: from that period
we have deviated from our course for twenty-one days, and we have no
wind to carry us back from the fate which awaits us after this day:
to-morrow we shall arrive at a mountain of black stone, called loadstone:
the current is now bearing us violently towards it, and the
ships will fall in pieces, and every nail in them will fly to the mountain,
and adhere to it; for God hath given to the loadstone a secret
property by virtue of which everything of iron is attracted towards it.
On that mountain is such a quantity of iron as no one knoweth but
God, whose name be exalted; for from times of old great numbers of
ships have been destroyed by the influence of that mountain.<a href="#III72" class="fnanchor">72</a> There
is, upon the summit of the mountain, a cupola of brass supported by
ten columns, and upon the top of this cupola is a horseman upon a
horse of brass, having in his hand a brazen spear, and upon his breast
suspended a tablet of lead, upon which are engraved mysterious names
and talismans: and as long, O King, as this horseman remains upon
the horse, so long will every ship that approaches be destroyed, with
every person on board, and all the iron contained in it will cleave to
the mountain: no one will be safe until the horseman shall have
fallen from the horse.&mdash;The captain then wept bitterly; and we felt
assured that our destruction was inevitable, and every one of us bade
adieu to his friend.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 546px; position: relative;"><a name="f75" id="f75"></a><img src="images/fig075.png" width="546" height="380" alt="The Mountain of Loadstone" title="The Mountain of Loadstone" /></div>

<p>On the following morning we drew near to the mountain; the
current carried us towards it with violence, and when the ships were
almost close to it, they fell asunder, and all the nails, and every thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
else that was of iron, flew from them towards the loadstone. It was near
the close of day when the ships fell in pieces. Some of us were
drowned, and some escaped; but the greater number were drowned,
and of those who saved their lives none knew what became of the
others, so stupefied were they by the waves and the boisterous wind.
As for myself, O my mistress, God, whose name be exalted, spared me
on account of the trouble and torment and affliction that He had predestined
to befall me. I placed myself upon a plank, and the wind and
waves cast it upon the mountain; and when I had landed, I found a
practicable way to the summit, resembling steps cut in the rock: so
I exclaimed, In the name of God!&mdash;and offered up a prayer, and
attempted the ascent, holding fast by the notches; and presently God
stilled the wind and assisted me in my endeavours, so that I arrived in
safety at the summit. Rejoicing greatly in my escape, I immediately
entered the cupola, and performed the prayers of two rek'ahs<a href="#III73" class="fnanchor">73</a> in
gratitude to God for my preservation; after which I slept beneath the
cupola, and heard a voice saying to me, O son of Kha&#7779;eeb,<a href="#III74" class="fnanchor">74</a> when
thou awakest from thy sleep, dig beneath thy feet, and thou wilt find
a bow of brass, and three arrows of lead, whereon are engraved talismans:
then take the bow and arrows and shoot at the horseman that
is upon the top of the cupola, and relieve mankind from this great
affliction; for when thou hast shot at the horseman he will fall into
the sea; the bow will also fall, and do thou bury it in its place; and
as soon as thou hast done this, the sea will swell and rise until it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
attains the summit of the mountain; and there will appear upon it a
boat bearing a man, different from him whom thou shalt have cast
down, and he will come to thee, having an oar in his hand: then do
thou embark with him; but utter not the name of God; and he will
convey thee in ten days to a safe sea, where, on thy arrival, thou wilt
find one who will take thee to thy city. All this shall be done if thou
utter not the name of God.</p>

<p>Awaking from my sleep, I sprang up, and did as the voice had
directed. I shot at the horseman, and he fell into the sea; and the
bow having fallen from my hand, I buried it: the sea then became
troubled, and rose to the summit of the mountain, and when I had
stood waiting there a little while, I beheld a boat in the midst of the
sea, approaching me. I praised God, whose name be exalted, and
when the boat came to me, I found in it a man of brass, with a tablet
of lead upon his breast, engraven with names and talismans. Without
uttering a word, I embarked in the boat, and the man rowed me ten
successive days, after which I beheld the islands of security, whereupon,
in the excess of my joy, I exclaimed, In the name of God!
There is no deity but God! God is most great!&mdash;and as soon as I
had done this, he cast me out of the boat, and sank in the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 592px; position: relative;"><a name="f76" id="f76"></a><img src="images/fig076.png" width="592" height="406" alt="The Prince thrown ashore" title="The Prince thrown ashore" /></div>

<p>Being able to swim, I swam until night, when my arms and
shoulders were tired, and, in this perilous situation, I repeated the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
profession of the faith, and gave myself up as lost; but the sea rose
with the violence of the wind, and a wave like a vast castle threw me
upon the land, in order to the accomplishment of the purpose of God.
I ascended the shore, and after I had wrung out my clothes, and
spread them upon the ground to dry, I slept; and in the morning I
put on my clothes again, and, looking about to see which way I should
go, I found a tract covered with trees, to which I advanced; and when
I had walked round it, I found that I was upon a small island in the
midst of the sea; upon which I said within myself, Every time that I
escape from one calamity I fall into another that is worse:&mdash;but while
I was reflecting upon my unfortunate case, and wishing for death, I
beheld a vessel bearing a number of men. I arose immediately, and
climbed into a tree; and lo, the vessel came to the shore, and there
landed from it ten black slaves bearing axes. They proceeded to the
middle of the island, and, digging up the earth, uncovered and lifted up
a trap-door, after which they returned to the vessel, and brought from
it bread and flour and clarified butter and honey and sheep and everything
that the wants of an inhabitant would require, continuing to pass
backwards and forwards between the vessel and the trap-door, bringing
loads from the former, and entering the latter, until they had removed
all the stores from the ship. They then came out of the vessel with
various clothes of the most beautiful description, and in the midst of
them was an old sheykh, enfeebled and wasted by extreme age, leading
by the hand a young man cast in the mould of graceful symmetry,
and invested with such perfect beauty as deserved to be a subject for
proverbs. He was like a fresh and slender twig, enchanting and
captivating every heart by his elegant form. The party proceeded
to the trap-door, and, entering it, became concealed from my
eyes.<a href="#III75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>They remained beneath about two hours, or more; after which, the
sheykh and the slaves came out; but the youth came not with them;
and they replaced the earth, and embarked and set sail. Soon after,
I descended from the tree, and went to the excavation. I removed
the earth, and, entering the aperture, saw a flight of wooden steps,
which I descended; and, at the bottom, I beheld a handsome dwelling-place,
furnished with a variety of silken carpets; and there was the
youth, sitting upon a high mattress, with sweet-smelling flowers and
fruits placed before him. On seeing me, his countenance became
pale; but I saluted him, and said, Let thy mind be composed, O my
master: thou hast nothing to fear, O delight of my eye; for I am a
man, and the son of a King, like thyself: fate hath impelled me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
thee, that I may cheer thee in thy solitude. The youth, when he
heard me thus address him, and was convinced that I was one of his
own species, rejoiced exceedingly at my arrival, his colour returned,
and, desiring me to approach him, he said, O my brother, my story is
wonderful: my father is a jeweller: he had slaves who made voyages
by his orders, for the purposes of commerce, and he had dealings with
Kings; but he had never been blest with a son; and he dreamt that
he was soon to have a son, but one whose life would be short; and he
awoke sorrowful.<a href="#III76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Shortly after, in accordance with the decrees of
God, my mother conceived me, and when her time was complete, she
gave birth to me; and my father was greatly rejoiced: the astrologers,
however, came to him, and said, Thy son will live fifteen years: his
fate is intimated by the fact that there is, in the sea, a mountain called
the Mountain of Loadstone, whereon is a horseman on a horse of brass,
on the former of which is a tablet of lead suspended to his neck; and
when the horseman shall be thrown down from his horse, thy son will
be slain: the person who is to slay him is he who will throw down
the horseman, and his name is King 'Ajeeb,<a href="#III77" class="fnanchor">77</a> the son of King Kha&#7779;eeb.
My father was greatly afflicted at this announcement; and when he
had reared me until I had nearly attained the age of fifteen years, the
astrologers came again, and informed him that the horseman had
fallen into the sea, and that it had been thrown down by King 'Ajeeb,
the son of King Kha&#7779;eeb; on hearing which, he prepared for me this
dwelling, and here left me to remain until the completion of the term,
of which there now remain ten days. All this he did from fear lest
King 'Ajeeb should kill me.</p>

<p>When I heard this, I was filled with wonder, and said within
myself, I am King 'Ajeeb, the son of King Kha&#7779;eeb, and it was I who
threw down the horseman; but, by Allah, I will neither kill him nor
do him any injury. Then said I to the youth, Far from thee be both
destruction and harm, if it be the will of God, whose name be exalted:
thou hast nothing to fear: I will remain with thee to serve thee, and
will go forth with thee to thy father, and beg of him to send me back
to my country, for the which he will obtain a reward. The youth
rejoiced at my words, and I sat and conversed with him until night,
when I spread his bed for him, and covered him, and slept near to his
side. And in the morning I brought him water, and he washed his
face, and said to me, May God requite thee for me with every blessing.
If I escape from King 'Ajeeb, I will make my father reward thee with
abundant favours.&mdash;Never, I replied, may the day arrive that would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
bring thee misfortune. I then placed before him some refreshments,
and after we had eaten together, we passed the day conversing with
the utmost cheerfulness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px; position: relative;"><a name="f77" id="f77"></a><img src="images/fig077.png" width="475" height="538" alt="Death of the Youth in the Cave" title="Death of the Youth in the Cave" /></div>

<p>I continued to serve him for nine days; and on the tenth day the
youth rejoiced at finding himself in safety, and said to me, O my
brother, I wish that thou wouldst in thy kindness warm for me some
water, that I may wash myself and change my clothes; for I have
smelt the odour of escape from death, in consequence of thy assistance.
&mdash;With pleasure, I replied;&mdash;and I arose, and warmed the water;
after which, he entered a place concealed from my view, and, having
washed himself and changed his clothes, laid himself upon the mattress
to rest after his bath. He then said to me, Cut up for me, O my
brother, a water-melon, and mix its juice with some sugar:&mdash;so I
arose, and, taking a melon, brought it upon a plate, and said to him,
Knowest thou, O my master, where is the knife?&mdash;See, here it is, he
answered, upon the shelf over my head. I sprang up hastily, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
took it from its sheath, and as I was drawing back, my foot slipped,
as God had decreed, and I fell upon the youth, grasping in my hand
the knife, which entered his body, and he died instantly. When
I perceived that he was dead, and that I had killed him, I uttered a
loud shriek, and beat my face, and rent my clothes, saying, This is,
indeed, a calamity! O what a calamity! O my Lord, I implore
thy pardon, and declare to Thee my innocence of his death! Would
that I had died before him! How long shall I devour trouble after
trouble!</p>

<p>With these reflections I ascended the steps, and, having replaced
the trap-door, returned to my first station, and looked over the sea,
where I saw the vessel that had come before, approaching, and cleaving
the waves in its rapid course. Upon this I said within myself, Now
will the men come forth from the vessel, and find the youth slain, and
they will slay me also:&mdash;so I climbed into a tree, and concealed
myself among its leaves, and sat there till the vessel arrived and cast
anchor, when the slaves landed with the old sheykh, the father of the
youth, and went to the place, and removed the earth. They were surprised
at finding it moist, and, when they had descended the steps, they
discovered the youth lying on his back, exhibiting a face beaming with
beauty, though dead, and clad in white and clean clothing, with the
knife remaining in his body. They all wept at the sight, and the
father fell down in a swoon, which lasted so long that the slaves
thought he was dead. At length, however, he recovered, and came
out with the slaves, who had wrapped the body of the youth in his
clothes. They then took back all that was in the subterranean
dwelling to the vessel, and departed.</p>

<p>I remained, O my mistress, by day hiding myself in a tree, and at
night walking about the open part of the island. Thus I continued
for the space of two months; and I perceived that, on the western
side of the island, the water of the sea every day retired, until, after
three months, the land that had been beneath it became dry. Rejoicing
at this, and feeling confident now in my escape, I traversed
this dry tract, and arrived at an expanse of sand; whereupon I emboldened
myself, and crossed it. I then saw in the distance an
appearance of fire, and, advancing towards it, found it to be a palace,
overlaid with plates of copper, which, reflecting the rays of the sun,
seemed from a distance to be fire: and when I drew near to it, reflecting
upon this sight, there approached me an old sheykh, accompanied
by ten young men who were all blind of one eye, at which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
was extremely surprised. As soon as they saw me, they saluted me,
and asked me my story, which I related to them from first to last;
and they were filled with wonder. They then conducted me into the
palace, where I saw ten benches, upon each of which was a mattress
covered with a blue stuff;<a href="#III78" class="fnanchor">78</a> and each of the young men seated
himself upon one of these benches, while the sheykh took his place
upon a smaller one; after which they said to me, Sit down, O young
man, and ask no question respecting our condition, nor respecting our
being blind of one eye. Then the sheykh arose, and brought to each
of them some food, and the same to me also; and next he brought to
each of us some wine: and after we had eaten, we sat drinking
together until the time for sleep, when the young men said to the
sheykh, Bring to us our accustomed supply:&mdash;upon which the sheykh
arose, and entered a closet, from which he brought, upon his head, ten
covered trays. Placing these upon the floor, he lighted ten candles,
and stuck one of them upon each tray; and, having done this, he
removed the covers, and there appeared beneath them ashes mixed
with pounded charcoal. The young men then tucked up their sleeves
above the elbow, and blackened their faces, and slapped their cheeks,<a href="#III79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
exclaiming, We were reposing at our ease, and our impertinent curiosity
suffered us not to remain so! Thus they did until the morning,
when the sheykh brought them some hot water, and they washed their
faces, and put on other clothes.</p>

<p>On witnessing this conduct, my reason was confounded, my heart
was so troubled that I forgot my own misfortunes, and I asked them
the cause of their strange behaviour; upon which they looked towards
me, and said, O young man, ask not respecting that which doth not
concern thee; but be silent; for in silence is security from error.&mdash;I
remained with them a whole month, during which, every night they
did the same; and at length I said to them, I conjure you by Allah
to remove this disquiet from my mind, and to inform me of the cause
of your acting in this manner, and of your exclaiming, We were
reposing at our ease, and our impertinent curiosity suffered us not to
remain so!&mdash;if ye inform me not, I will leave you, and go my way;
for the proverb saith, When the eye seeth not, the heart doth not
grieve.&mdash;On hearing these words, they replied, We have not concealed
this affair from thee but in our concern for thy welfare, lest thou
shouldst become like us, and the same affliction that hath befallen us
happen also to thee. I said, however, Ye must positively inform
me of this matter.&mdash;We give thee good advice, said they, and do thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
receive it, and ask us not respecting our case; otherwise thou wilt
become blind of one eye, like us:&mdash;but I still persisted in my request;
whereupon they said, O young man, if this befall thee, know that thou
wilt be banished from our company. They then all arose, and, taking
a ram, slaughtered and skinned it, and said to me, Take this knife
with thee, and introduce thyself into the skin of the ram, and we will
sew thee up in it, and go away; whereupon a bird called the rukh'<a href="#III80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
will come to thee, and, taking thee up by its talons, will fly away with
thee, and set thee down upon a mountain: then cut open the skin
with this knife, and get out, and the bird will fly away. Thou must
arise, as soon as it hath gone, and journey for half a day, and thou
wilt see before thee a lofty palace, encased with red gold, set with
various precious stones, such as emeralds and rubies, &amp;c.; and if thou
enter it thy case will be as ours; for our entrance into that palace was
the cause of our being blind of one eye; and if one of us would relate
to thee all that hath befallen him, his story would be too long for thee
to hear.</p>

<p>They then sewed me up in the skin, and entered their palace; and
soon after, there came an enormous white bird, which seized me, and
flew away with me, and set me down upon the mountain; whereupon
I cut open the skin, and got out; and the bird, as soon as it saw me,
flew away. I rose up quickly, and proceeded towards the palace,
which I found to be as they had described it to me; and when I had
entered it, I beheld, at the upper end of a saloon, forty young damsels,
beautiful as so many moons, and magnificently attired, who, as soon as
they saw me, exclaimed, Welcome! Welcome! O our master and our
lord! We have been for a month expecting thee. Praise be to God
who hath blessed us with one who is worthy of us, and one of whom
we are worthy!&mdash;After having thus greeted me, they seated me upon
a mattress, and said, Thou art from this day our master and prince,
and we are thy handmaids, and entirely under thy authority. They
then brought to me some refreshments, and, when I had eaten and
drunk, they sat and conversed with me, full of joy and happiness. So
lovely were these ladies, that even a devotee, if he saw them, would
gladly consent to be their servant, and to comply with all that they
would desire. At the approach of night they all assembled around me,
and placed before me a table of fresh and dried fruits, with other
delicacies that the tongue cannot describe, and wine; and one began
to sing, while another played upon the lute. The wine-cups circulated
among us, and joy overcame me to such a degree as to obliterate from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
my mind every earthly care, and make me exclaim, This is indeed a
delightful life! I passed a night of such enjoyment as I had never
before experienced; and on the morrow I entered the bath; and, after
I had washed myself, they brought me a suit of the richest clothing,
and we again sat down to a repast.</p>

<p>In this manner I lived with them a whole year; but on the first
day of the new year, they seated themselves around me, and began to
weep, and bade me farewell, clinging to my skirts.&mdash;What calamity
hath befallen you? said I. Ye have broken my heart.&mdash;They answered,
Would that we had never known thee; for we have associated with
many men, but have seen none like thee. May God, therefore, not
deprive us of thy company.&mdash;And they wept afresh. I said to them,
I wish that you would acquaint me with the cause of this weeping.&mdash;Thou,
they replied, art the cause; yet now, if thou wilt attend to what
we tell thee, we shall never be parted; but if thou act contrary to it, we
are separated from this time; and our hearts whisper to us that thou wilt
not regard our warning.&mdash;Inform me, said I, and I will attend to your
directions:&mdash;and they replied, If then thou wouldst inquire respecting
our history, know that we are the daughters of Kings: for many years
it hath been our custom to assemble here, and every year we absent
ourselves during a period of forty days; then returning, we indulge
ourselves for a year in feasting and drinking. This is our usual practice;
and now we fear that thou wilt disregard our directions when we
are absent from thee. We deliver to thee the keys of the palace,
which are a hundred in number, belonging to a hundred closets.
Open each of these, and amuse thyself, and eat and drink, and refresh
thyself, excepting the closet that hath a door of red gold; for if thou
open this, the consequence will be a separation between us and thee.
We conjure thee, therefore, to observe our direction, and to be patient
during this period.&mdash;Upon hearing this, I swore to them that I would
never open the closet to which they alluded; and they departed, urging
me to be faithful to my promise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 510px; position: relative;"><a name="f78" id="f78"></a><img src="images/fig078.png" width="515" height="567" alt="Garden" title="Garden" /></div>

<p>I remained alone in the palace, and at the approach of evening I
opened the first closet, and, entering it, found a mansion like paradise,
with a garden containing green trees loaded with ripe fruits, abounding
with singing birds, and watered by copious streams. My heart was
soothed by the sight, and I wandered among the trees, scenting the
fragrance of the flowers, and listening to the warbling of the birds as
they sang the praises of the One, the Almighty.<a href="#III81" class="fnanchor">81</a> After admiring the
mingled colours of the apple resembling the hue upon the cheek of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
beloved mistress and the sallow countenance of the perplexed and
timid lover, the sweet-smelling quince diffusing an odour like musk
and ambergris, and the plum shining as the ruby, I retired from this
place, and, having locked the door, opened that of the next closet,
within which I beheld a spacious tract planted with numerous palm-trees,
and watered by a river flowing among rose-trees, and jasmine,
and marjoram, and eglantine, and narcissus, and gilliflower, the odours
of which, diffused in every direction by the wind, inspired me with the
utmost delight. I locked again the door of the second closet, and
opened that of the third. Within this I found a large saloon, paved
with marbles of various colours, and with costly minerals and precious
gems, and containing cages constructed of sandal and aloes-wood with
singing birds within them, and others upon the branches of trees which
were planted there. My heart was charmed, my trouble was dissipated,
and I slept there until the morning. I then opened the door of the
fourth closet, and within this door I found a great building in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
were forty closets with open doors; and, entering these, I beheld
pearls, and rubies, and chrysolites, and emeralds, and other precious
jewels such as the tongue cannot describe. I was astonished at the
sight, and said, Such things as these, I imagine, are not found in the
treasury of any King. I am now the King of my age, and all these
treasures, through the goodness of God, are mine, together with forty
damsels under my authority who have no man to share them with me.</p>

<p>Thus I continued to amuse myself, passing from one place to
another, until thirty-nine days had elapsed, and I had opened the
doors of all the closets excepting that which they had forbidden me to
open. My heart was then disturbed by curiosity respecting this
hundredth closet, and the Devil, in order to plunge me into misery,
induced me to open it. I had not patience to abstain, though there
remained of the appointed period only one day: so I approached the
closet, and opened the door; and when I had entered, I perceived a
fragrant odour, such as I had never before smelt, which intoxicated me
so that I fell down insensible, and remained some time in this state:
but at length recovering, I fortified my heart, and proceeded. I found
the floor overspread with saffron, and the place illuminated by golden
lamps and by candles, which diffused the odours of musk and ambergris;
and two large perfuming-vessels filled with aloes-wood and
ambergris, and a perfume compounded with honey, spread fragrance
through the whole place. I saw also a black horse, of the hue of the
darkest night, before which was a manger of white crystal filled with
cleansed sesame, and another, similar to it, containing rose-water
infused with musk: he was saddled and bridled, and his saddle was of
red gold. Wondering at the sight of him, I said within myself, This
must be an animal of extraordinary qualities;&mdash;and, seduced by the
Devil, I led him out, and mounted him; but he moved not from his
place: I kicked him with my heel; but still he moved not: so I took
a mi&#7731;ra'ah and struck him with it; and as soon as he felt the blow he
uttered a sound like thunder, and, expanding a pair of wings, soared
with me to an immense height through the air, and then alighted upon
the roof of another palace, where he threw me from his back, and, by
a violent blow with his tail upon my face, as I sat on the roof, struck
out my eye, and left me.<a href="#III82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>In this state I descended from the roof, and below I found the
one-eyed young men before mentioned, who, as soon as they beheld
me, exclaimed, No welcome to thee!&mdash;Receive me, said I, into your
company:&mdash;but they replied, By Allah, thou shalt not remain with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
us:&mdash;so I departed from them, with mournful heart and weeping eye,
and, God having decreed me a safe journey hither, I arrived at
Baghd&aacute;d, after I had shaved my beard, and become a mendicant.<a href="#III83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF THE LADIES OF BAGHD&Aacute;D, &amp;c.</h5>

<p>The mistress of the house then looked towards the Khaleefeh and
Ja&#7841;far and Mesroor, and said to them, Acquaint me with your
histories:&mdash;upon which Ja&#7841;far advanced towards her, and related to
her the same story that he had told to the portress before they entered;
and when she had heard it, she liberated them all. They accordingly
departed, and when they had gone out into the street, the Khaleefeh
inquired of the mendicants whither they were going. They answered
that they knew not whither to go: whereupon he desired them to
accompany his party; and then said to Ja&#7841;far, Take them home with
thee, and bring them before me to-morrow, and we will see the result.
Ja&#7841;far, therefore, did as he was commanded, and the Khaleefeh
returned to his palace; but he was unable to sleep during the
remainder of the night.</p>

<p>On the following morning he sat upon his throne, and when his
courtiers had presented themselves before him, and departed, excepting
Ja&#7841;far, he said to him, Bring before me the three ladies and the two
bitches and the mendicants. So Ja&#7841;far arose, and brought them, and,
placing the ladies behind the curtains, said to them, We have forgiven
you on account of your previous kindness to us, and because ye knew
us not; and now I acquaint you that ye are in the presence of the
fifth of the sons of El-'Abb&aacute;s, H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed; therefore relate to
him nothing but the truth. And when the ladies heard the words
which Ja&#7841;far addressed to them on the part of the Khaleefeh, the
eldest of them advanced, and thus related her story:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE FIRST OF THE THREE LADIES
OF BAGHD&Aacute;D.</h5>

<p>O Prince of the Faithful, my story is wonderful; for these two
bitches<a href="#III84" class="fnanchor">84</a> are my sisters, born to my father, but of another mother; and
I am the youngest of the three. After the death of our father, who
left us five thousand pieces of gold, these my two sisters married, and
when they had resided some time with their husbands, each of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
latter prepared a stock of merchandise, and received from his wife a
thousand pieces of gold, and they all set forth on a journey together,
leaving me here; but after they had been absent four years, my
sisters' husbands lost all their property, and abandoned them in a
strange land, and they returned to me in the garb of beggars. When
I first saw them in this state, I knew them not; and, as soon as I
recognised them, I exclaimed, How is it that ye are in this condition?&mdash;O
our sister, they answered, thy inquiry now is of no use: the Pen
hath written what God hath decreed.<a href="#III85" class="fnanchor">85</a>&mdash;I sent them, therefore, to the
bath, and, having clad them in new apparel, said to them, O my
sisters, ye are my elders, and I am young; so ye shall be to me in
the places of my father and mother. The inheritance which I shared
with you God hath blessed; partake then of its increase, for my affairs
are prosperous; and I and ye shall fare alike.&mdash;I treated them with
the utmost kindness, and during a whole year they remained with me,
and enriched themselves by the money that I had given them; but
after this period they said to me, It will be more agreeable to us to
marry again, for we can no longer abstain from doing so.&mdash;O my
sisters, I replied, ye have seen no happiness in marriage: a good
husband in this age is rarely found, and ye have already had experience
of the marriage-state. They, however, heeded not my words;
but married against my consent: yet I gave them dowries from my
own property, and continued to them my protection. They went to
their husbands, and the latter, after they had resided with them a
short time, defrauded them of all that they possessed, and, setting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
forth on a journey, left them destitute: so again they returned to me,
and, in a state of nudity, implored my forgiveness, saying, Be not
angry with us; for though thou art younger than we, thou hast more
mature sense; and we promise thee that we will never again mention
the subject of marriage. I replied, Ye are welcome, O my sisters; for
I have no one dearer to me than yourselves:&mdash;and I received them,
and treated them with every kindness, and we remained happily
together for the space of a year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 552px; position: relative;"><a name="f79" id="f79"></a><img src="images/fig079.png" width="552" height="377" alt="First Lady recognising her Sisters" title="First Lady recognising her Sisters" /></div>

<p>After this I resolved to fit out a vessel for a mercantile voyage:<a href="#III86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
accordingly, I stocked a large ship with various goods and necessary
provisions, and said to my sisters, Will ye rather stay at home during
my voyage, or will ye go with me?&mdash;to which they answered, We will
accompany thee during the voyage, for we cannot endure to be
separated from thee. I therefore took them with me, and we set
sail; but first I divided my property into two equal portions; one of
which I took with me, and the other I concealed, saying within myself,
Perhaps some evil accident may happen to the ship, and our lives
may be prolonged; in which case, when we return we shall find that
which will be of service to us.&mdash;We continued our voyage by day and
night, till at length the vessel pursued a wrong course, and the captain
knew not whither to steer. The ship had entered a different sea from
that which we wished to cross, and for some time we knew it not; but
for ten days we had a pleasant wind, and after this, a city loomed
before us in the distance. We asked the captain what was the name
of this city; and he answered, I know it not; I have never seen it till
this day, nor have I ever before in the course of my life navigated this
sea: but as we have come hither in safety, ye have nothing to do but
to enter this city and land your goods, and, if ye find opportunity, sell
or exchange there: if not, we will rest there two days, and take in
fresh provisions. So we entered the port of the city, and the captain
landed, and after a while returned to us, saying, Arise, and go up into
the city, and wonder at that which God hath done unto his creatures,
and pray to be preserved from his anger. And when we had entered
the city, we found all its inhabitants converted into black stones. We
were amazed at the sight, and as we walked through the market-streets,
finding the merchandise and the gold and silver remaining in
their original state, we rejoiced, and said, This must have been
occasioned by same wonderful circumstance. We then separated in
the streets, each of us attracted from his companions by the wealth
and stuffs in the shops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>As for myself, I ascended to the citadel, which I found to be a
building of admirable construction; and, entering the King's palace,
I found all the vessels of gold and silver remaining in their places,
and the King himself seated in the midst of his Chamberlains and
Viceroys and Wezeers, and clad in apparel of astonishing richness.
Drawing nearer to him, I perceived that he was sitting upon a throne
adorned with pearls and jewels, every one of the pearls shining like a
star: his dress was embroidered with gold, and around him stood fifty
memlooks, attired in silks of various descriptions, and having in their
hands drawn swords. Stupefied at this spectacle, I proceeded, and
entered the saloon of the &#7716;areem, upon the walls of which were hung
silken curtains; and here I beheld the Queen, attired in a dress embroidered
with fresh pearls, and having upon her head a diadem
adorned with various jewels, and necklaces of different kinds on her
neck. All her clothing and ornaments remained as they were at first,
though she herself was converted into black stone. Here also I found
an open door, and, entering it, I saw a flight of seven steps, by which
I ascended to an apartment paved with marble, furnished with gold-embroidered
carpets, and containing a couch of alabaster, ornamented
with pearls and jewels; but my eyes were first attracted by a gleam of
light, and when I approached the spot whence it proceeded, I found a
brilliant jewel, of the size of an ostrich's egg, placed upon a small
stool, diffusing a light like that of a candle. The coverings of the
couch above mentioned were of various kinds of silk, the richness of
which would surprise every beholder; and I looked at them with
wonder. In this apartment I likewise observed some lighted candles,
and reflected that there must then have been some person there to light
them. I passed thence to another part of the palace, and continued
to explore the different apartments, forgetting myself in the amazement
of my mind at all these strange circumstances, and immersed in thoughts
respecting what I beheld, until the commencement of night, when I
would have departed; but could not find the door: so I returned to
the place in which were the lighted candles, and there I laid myself
upon the couch, and, covering myself with a quilt, repeated some words
of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and endeavoured to compose myself to sleep; but I
could not. I continued restless: and at midnight I heard a recitation
of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, performed by a melodious and soft voice; upon which
I arose, and, looking about, saw a closet with an open door, and I
entered it, and found that it was an oratory: lighted lamps were
suspended in it, and upon a prayer-carpet spread on the floor sat a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
young man of handsome aspect. Wondering that he had escaped the
fate of the other inhabitants of the city, I saluted him; and he raised
his eyes, and returned my salutation: and I then said to him, I conjure
thee by the truth of that which thou art reading in the Book of
God, that thou answer the question which I am about to ask thee:&mdash;whereupon
he smiled, and replied, Do thou first acquaint me with the
cause of thine entrance into this place, and then I will answer thy
question: so I told him my story, and inquired of him the history of
this city. Wait a little, said he;&mdash;and he closed the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and,
having put it in a bag of satin, seated me by his side. As I now
beheld him, his countenance appeared like the full moon, and his
whole person exhibited such perfect elegance and loveliness, that a
single glance at him drew from me a thousand sighs, and kindled a fire
in my heart. I repeated my request that he would give me an account
of the city; and, replying, I hear and obey, he thus addressed me:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 503px; position: relative;"><a name="f80" id="f80"></a><img src="images/fig080.png" width="503" height="549" alt="The Prince in the Oratory" title="The Prince in the Oratory" /></div>

<p>Know that this city belonged to my father and his family and
subjects; and he is the King whom thou hast seen converted into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
stone; and the Queen whom thou hast seen is my mother. They
were all Magians, worshipping fire in the place of the Almighty King;<a href="#III87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
and they swore by the fire and the light, and the shade and the heat,
and the revolving orb. My father had no son, till, in his declining
years, he was blest with me, whom he reared until I attained to manhood.
But, happily for me, there was, in our family, an old woman,
far advanced in age, who was a Muslimeh, believing in God and his
Apostle in her heart, though she conformed with my family in outward
observances; and my father confided in her, on account of the faithfulness
and modesty that he had observed in her character, and shewed
her great favour, firmly believing that she held the same faith as himself;
therefore, when I had passed my infancy, he committed me to
her care, saying, Take him, and rear him, and instruct him in the
ordinances of our faith, and educate him and serve him in the best
manner. The old woman accordingly received me, but took care to
instruct me in the faith of El-Isl&aacute;m, teaching me the laws of purification,
and the divine ordinances of ablution, together with the forms of
prayer; after which she made me commit to memory the whole of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n. She then charged me to keep my faith a secret from my
father, lest he should kill me; and I did so; and a few days after, the
old woman died. The inhabitants of the city had now increased in
their impiety and arrogance, and in their dereliction of the truth; and
while they were in this state, they heard a crier proclaim with a voice
like thunder, so as to be audible to both the near and the distant, O
inhabitants of this city, abstain from the worship of fire, and worship
the Almighty King!&mdash;The people were struck with consternation, and,
flocking to my father, the King of the city, said to him, What is this
alarming voice which hath astounded us by its terrible sound?&mdash;but
he answered them, Let not the voice terrify you, nor let it turn you
from your faith:&mdash;and their hearts inclined to his words; so they
persevered in the worship of fire, and remained obstinate in their
impiety during another year, until the return of the period at which
they had heard the voice the first time. It was then heard a second
time; and again, in the next year, they heard it a third time; but
still they persisted in their evil ways, until, drawing down upon themselves
the abhorrence and indignation of Heaven, one morning, shortly
after daybreak, they were converted into black stones, together with
their beasts and all their cattle. Not one of the inhabitants of the city
escaped, excepting me; and from the day on which this catastrophe
happened, I have continued occupied as thou seest, in prayer, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
fasting, and reading the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n: but I have become weary of this
solitary state, having no one to cheer me with his company.</p>

<p>On hearing these words, I said to him, Wilt thou go with me to
the city of Baghd&aacute;d, and visit its learned men and lawyers, and increase
thy knowledge? If so, I will be thy handmaid, though I am
the mistress of my family, and have authority over a household of
men. I have here a ship laden with merchandise, and destiny hath
driven us to this city, in order that we might become acquainted with
these events: our meeting was predestined.&mdash;In this manner I continued
to persuade him until he gave his consent. I slept that night
at his feet, unconscious of my state through excessive joy; and in the
morning we rose, and, entering the treasuries, took away a quantity
of the lighter and most valuable of the articles that they contained,
and descended from the citadel into the city, where we met the slaves
and the captain, who were searching for me. They were rejoiced at
seeing me, and, to their questions respecting my absence, I replied by
informing them of all that I had seen, and related to them the history
of the young man, and the cause of the transmutation of the people of
the city, and of all that had befallen them, which filled them with
wonder. But when my two sisters saw me with the young man, they
envied me on his account, and malevolently plotted against me.</p>

<p>We embarked again, and I experienced the utmost happiness,
chiefly owing to the company of the young man; and after we had
waited a while till the wind was favourable, we spread our sails, and
departed. My sisters sat with me and the young man; and, in their
conversation with me, said, O our sister, what dost thou purpose to do
with this handsome youth? I answered, I desire to take him as my
husband:&mdash;and, turning to him, and approaching him, I said, O my
master, I wish to make a proposal to thee, and do not thou oppose it.
He replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and I then looked towards my sisters,
and said to them, This young man is all that I desire, and all the
wealth that is here is yours.&mdash;Excellent, they replied, is thy determination:&mdash;yet
still they designed evil against me.&mdash;We
continued our voyage with a favourable wind, and, quitting the sea of peril,
entered the sea of security, across which we proceeded for some days,
until we drew near to the city of El-Ba&#7779;rah, the buildings of which
loomed before us at the approach of evening; but as soon as we had
fallen asleep, my sisters took us up in our bed, both myself and the
young man, and threw us into the sea. The youth, being unable to
swim, was drowned: God recorded him among the company of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
martyrs;<a href="#III88" class="fnanchor">88</a> while I was registered among those whose life was yet to
be preserved; and, accordingly, as soon as I awoke and found myself
in the sea, the providence of God supplied me with a piece of timber,
upon which I placed myself, and the waves cast me upon the shore of
an island.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 503px; position: relative;"><a name="f81" id="f81"></a><img src="images/fig081.png" width="503" height="647" alt="First Lady after killing the Serpent" title="First Lady after killing the Serpent" /></div>

<p>During the remainder of the night I walked along this island, and
in the morning I saw a neck of land, bearing the marks of a man's
feet, and uniting with the main land. The sun having now risen, I
dried my clothes in its rays, and proceeded along the path that I had
discovered until I drew near to the shore upon which stands the city,
when I beheld a snake approaching me, and followed by a serpent
which was endeavouring to destroy it; the tongue of the snake was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
hanging from its mouth in consequence of excessive fatigue, and it
excited my compassion; so I took up a stone, and threw it at the
head of the serpent, which instantly died: the snake then extended a
pair of wings, and soared aloft into the sky, leaving me in wonder at
the sight. At the time of this occurrence I had become so fatigued,
that I now laid myself down and slept; but I awoke after a little
while, and found a damsel seated at my feet, and gently rubbing
them with her hands; upon which I immediately sat up, feeling
ashamed that she should perform this service for me, and said to
her, Who art thou, and what dost thou want?&mdash;How soon has thou
forgotten me! she exclaimed: I am she to whom thou hast just done
a kindness, by killing my enemy: I am the snake whom thou savedst
from the serpent; for I am a Jinneeyeh, and the serpent was a Jinnee
at enmity with me; and none but thou delivered me from him:
therefore, as soon as thou didst this, I flew to the ship from which
thy sisters cast thee, and transported all that it contained to thy
house: I then sunk it; but as to thy sisters, I transformed them by
enchantment into two black bitches; for I knew all that they had
done to thee: the young man, however, is drowned.&mdash;Having thus
said, she took me up, and placed me with the two black bitches on
the roof of my house: and I found all the treasures that the ship had
contained collected in the midst of my house: nothing was lost. She
then said to me, I swear by that which was engraved upon the seal of
Suleym&aacute;n, that, if thou do not inflict three hundred lashes upon each
of these bitches every day, I will come and transform thee in the like
manner:&mdash;so I replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and have continued ever
since to inflict upon them these stripes, though pitying them while I
do so.</p>

<p>The Khaleefeh heard this story with astonishment, and then said
to the second lady, And what occasioned the stripes of which thou
bearest the marks? She answered as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE SECOND OF THE THREE LADIES
OF BAGHD&Aacute;D.</h5>

<p>O Prince of the Faithful, my father, at his death, left considerable
property; and soon after that event I married to one of the wealthiest
men of the age, who, when I had lived with him a year, died, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
inherited from him eighty thousand pieces of gold, the portion that
fell to me according to the law;<a href="#III89" class="fnanchor">89</a> with part of which I made for
myself ten suits of clothing, each of the value of a thousand pieces of
gold. And as I was sitting one day, there entered my apartment an
old woman, disgustingly ugly, who saluted me, and said, I have an
orphan daughter whose marriage I am to celebrate this night, and I
would have thee obtain a reward and recompense in heaven by thy
being present at her nuptial festivity; for she is broken-hearted,
having none to befriend her but God, whose name be exalted. She
then wept, and kissed my feet; and, being moved with pity and compassion,
I assented, upon which she desired me to prepare myself,
telling me that she would come at the hour of nightfall and take me;
and so saying, she kissed my hand, and departed.</p>

<p>I arose immediately, and attired myself, and when I had completed
my preparations, the old woman returned, saying, O my mistress,
the ladies of the city have arrived, and I have informed them of thy
coming, and they are waiting with joy to receive thee:&mdash;so I put on
my outer garments, and, taking my female slaves with me, proceeded
until we arrived at a street in which a soft wind was delightfully
playing, where we saw a gateway over-arched with a marble vault,
admirably constructed, forming the entrance to a palace which rose
from the earth to the clouds.<a href="#III90" class="fnanchor">90</a> On our arrival there, the old woman
knocked at the door, and, when it was opened, we entered a carpeted
passage, illuminated by lamps and candles, and decorated with jewels
and precious metals.<a href="#III91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Through this passage we passed into a saloon
of unequalled magnificence, furnished with mattresses covered with
silk, lighted by hanging lamps and by candles, and having, at its
upper end, a couch of alabaster decorated with pearls and jewels, and
canopied by curtains of satin, from which there came forth a lady
beautiful as the moon, who exclaimed to me, Most welcome art thou,
O my sister: thou delightest me by thy company, and refreshest my
heart. She then sat down again, and said to me, O my sister, I have
a brother who hath seen thee at a festivity: he is a young man, more
handsome than myself, and, his heart being violently inflamed with
love of thee, he hath bribed this old woman to go to thee, and to
employ this artifice in order to obtain for me an interview with thee.
He desireth to marry thee according to the ordinance of God and his
Apostle, and in that which is lawful there is no disgrace.&mdash;When I
heard these words, and saw myself thus confined in the house so that
I could not escape, I replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and the lady, re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>joicing
at my consent, clapped her hands, and opened a door, upon
which there came out from it a young man so surpassingly handsome,
that my heart immediately inclined to him. No sooner had he sat
down than the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee and four witnesses entered, and saluted us, and
proceeded to perform the ceremony of the marriage-contract<a href="#III92" class="fnanchor">92</a> between
me and the young man; which having done, they departed; and
when they had retired, the young man looked towards me, and said,
May our night be blessed. He then informed me that he desired to
impose a covenant upon me, and, bringing a copy of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, said,
Swear that thou wilt not indulge a preference, nor at all incline, to
any man but me:&mdash;and when I had sworn to this effect, he rejoiced
exceedingly, and embraced me; and the love of him took entire possession
of my heart.</p>

<p>We lived together in the utmost happiness for the space of a
month, after which I begged that he would allow me to go to the
b&aacute;z&aacute;r, in order to purchase some stuffs for dress, and, having obtained
his permission, went thither in company with the old woman, and
seated myself at the shop of a young merchant with whom she was
acquainted, and whose father, as she informed me, had died and left
him great wealth. She desired him to shew me his most costly
stuffs; and while he was occupied in doing so, she began to utter
various flattering expressions in praise of him; but I said to her, We
have no concern with the praises that thou bestowest upon him; we
desire only to make our purchase, and to return home. Meanwhile
he produced to us what we wanted, and we handed him the money:
he refused, however, to take it, saying, It is an offering of hospitality
to you for your visit this day:&mdash;whereupon I said to the old woman,
If he will not take the money, return to him his stuff. But he would
not receive it again, and exclaimed, By Allah, I will take nothing from
you: all this is a present from me for a single kiss, which I shall
value more than the entire contents of my shop.&mdash;What will a kiss
profit thee? asked the old woman. Then, turning to me, she said, O
my daughter, thou hast heard what the youth hath said: no harm
will befall thee if he give thee a kiss, and thou shalt take what thou
wantest.&mdash;Dost thou not know, said I, that I have taken an oath?
She answered, Let him kiss thee then without thy speaking, and so it
will be of no consequence to thee, and thou shalt take back thy
money. Thus she continued to palliate the matter until I put my
head (as it were) into the bag, and consented: so I covered my eyes,
and held the edge of my veil in such a manner as to prevent the pas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>sengers
from seeing me, whereupon he put his mouth to my cheek
beneath the veil, but instead of merely kissing me, he lacerated my
cheek by a violent bite. I fell into a swoon from the pain, and the
old woman laid me on her lap till I recovered, when I found the shop
closed, and the old woman uttering expressions of grief, and saying,
What God hath averted would have been a greater calamity; let us
return home, and do thou feign to be ill, and I will come to thee and
apply a remedy that shall cure the wound, and thou wilt quickly be
restored.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 541px; position: relative;"><a name="f82" id="f82"></a><img src="images/fig082.png" width="541" height="650" alt="B&aacute;z&aacute;r, or Market-Street" title="B&aacute;z&aacute;r, or Market-Street" /></div>

<p>After remaining there some time longer, I rose, and, in a state of
great uneasiness and fear, returned to the house, and professed myself
ill, upon which my husband came in to me, and said, What hath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
befallen thee, O my mistress, during this excursion? I answered, I
am not well.&mdash;And what is this wound, said he, that is upon thy
cheek, and in the soft part? I answered, When I asked thy permission,
and went out to-day to purchase some stuff for dress, a camel
loaded with firewood drove against me in the crowd, and tore my
veil, and wounded my cheek as thou seest, for the streets of this city
are narrow.<a href="#III93" class="fnanchor">93</a>&mdash;To-morrow, then, he exclaimed, I will go to the governor,
and make a complaint to him, and he shall hang every seller of
firewood in the city.&mdash;By Allah, said I, burden not thyself by an
injury to any one; for the truth is, that I was riding upon an ass,
which took fright with me, and I fell upon the ground, and a stick
lacerated my cheek.&mdash;If it be so, then, he replied, I will go to-morrow
to Ja&#7841;far El-Barmekee, and relate the matter to him, and he
shall kill every ass-driver in this city.&mdash;Wilt thou, said I, kill all
those men on my account, when this which befell me was decreed by
God?&mdash;Undoubtedly, he answered; and, so saying, he seized me
violently, and then sprang up, and uttered a loud cry, upon which the
door opened, and there came forth from it seven black slaves, who
dragged me from my bed, and threw me down in the middle of the
apartment; whereupon he ordered one of them to hold me by my
shoulders and to sit upon my head; and another, to sit upon my
knees and to hold my feet. A third then came, with a sword in his
hand, and said, O my lord, shall I strike her with the sword, and
cleave her in twain, that each of these may take a half and throw it
into the Tigris for the fish to devour?<a href="#III94" class="fnanchor">94</a> For such is the punishment
of her who is unfaithful to her oath and to the laws of love.&mdash;My
husband answered, Strike her, O Sa&#7841;d:<a href="#III95" class="fnanchor">95</a>&mdash;and the slave, with the
drawn sword in his hand, said, Repeat the profession of the faith, and
reflect what thou wouldst have to be done, that thou mayest give thy
testamentary directions, for this is the end of thy life.&mdash;Good slave, I
replied, release me for a while that I may do so:&mdash;and I raised my
head, and, weeping as I spoke, addressed my husband with these
verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You render me lovelorn, and remain at ease. You make my wounded eyelid to be restless, and you sleep.</span>
<span class="i0">Your abode is between my heart and my eyes; and my heart will not relinquish you, nor my tears conceal my passion.</span>
<span class="i0">You made a covenant with me that you would remain faithful; but when you had gained possession of my heart you deceived me.</span>
<span class="i0">Will you not pity my love for you and my moaning? Have you yourself been secure from misfortunes?</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
<span class="i0">I conjure you, by Allah, if I die, that you write upon my tombstone, This was a slave of love.</span>
<span class="i0">That, perchance, some mourner who hath felt the same flame may pass by the lover's grave, and pity her.<a href="#III96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But on hearing these verses, and witnessing my weeping, he became
more incensed, and replied in the words of this couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I reject not the beloved of my heart from weariness: her own guilty conduct is the cause of her punishment.</span>
<span class="i0">She desired that another should share with me her love; but the faith of my heart inclineth not to partnership.<a href="#III97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px; position: relative;"><a name="f83" id="f83"></a><img src="images/fig083.png" width="590" height="521" alt="Old Woman interceding for the Second Lady" title="Old Woman interceding for the Second Lady" /></div>

<p>I continued to weep, and to endeavour to excite his compassion,
saying within myself, I will humble me before him, and address him
with soft words, that he may at least refrain from killing me, though
he take all that I possess;&mdash;but he cried out to the slave, Cleave her
in twain; for she is no longer of any value to us.&mdash;So the slave
approached me, and I now felt assured of my death, and committed
myself to God; but suddenly the old woman came and threw herself
at my husband's feet, and, kissing them, exclaimed, O my son, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
care with which I nursed thee, I conjure thee to pardon this damsel,
for she hath committed no offence that deserveth such a punishment:
thou art young, and I fear the effect of the imprecations that she may
utter against thee:&mdash;and after she had thus addressed him, she wept,
and continued to importune him, until, at length, he said, I pardon
her, but must cause her to bear upon her person such marks of her
offence as shall last for the remainder of her life. So saying, he
commanded the slaves to strip off my vest, and, taking a stick cut
from a quince-tree, he beat me upon my back and my sides until I
became insensible from the violence of the blows, and despaired of my
life. He then ordered the slaves to take me away as soon as it was
night, accompanied by the old woman, and to throw me into my house
in which I formerly resided. They accordingly executed their lord's
commands, and when they had deposited me in my house, I applied
myself to the healing of my wounds; but, after I had cured myself,
my sides still bore the appearance of having been beaten with mi&#7731;ra'ahs.
I continued to apply remedies for four months before I was restored,
and then repaired to view the house in which this event had happened;
but I found it reduced to ruin, and the whole street pulled down; the
site of the house I found occupied by mounds of rubbish, and I knew
not the cause.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I went to reside with this my sister,
who is of the same father as myself, and I found with her these two
bitches. Having saluted her, I informed her of all that had befallen
me; to which she replied, Who is secure from the afflictions of fortune?
Praise be to God who terminated the affair with safety to thy life!&mdash;She
then related to me her own story, and that of her two sisters, and
I remained with her, and neither of us ever mentioned the subject of
marriage. Afterwards we were joined by this our other sister, the
cateress, who every day goes out to purchase for us whatever we happen
to want.</p>

<h5>CONCLUSION OF THE STORY OF THE LADIES OF BAGHD&Aacute;D, &amp;c.</h5>

<p>The Kaleefeh was astonished at this story, and ordered it to be
recorded in a book, as an authentic history, and deposited the book in
his library. And he said to the first lady, Knowest thou where the
Jinneeyeh<a href="#III98" class="fnanchor">98</a> who enchanted thy sisters is to be found? She answered,
O Prince of the Faithful, she gave me a lock of her hair, and said,
When thou desirest my presence, burn a few of these hairs, and I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
be with thee quickly, though I should be beyond Mount &#7730;&aacute;f.&mdash;Bring
then the hair, said the Khaleefeh. The lady, therefore, produced it;
and the Khaleefeh, taking it, burned a portion of it, and, when the
odour had diffused itself, the palace shook, and they heard a sound of
thunder, and lo, the Jinneeyeh appeared before them. She was a
Muslimeh, and therefore greeted the Khaleefeh by saying, Peace be
on thee, O Khaleefeh of God!&mdash;to which he replied, On you be peace,
and the mercy of God, and his blessings!<a href="#III99" class="fnanchor">99</a>&mdash;She then said, Know
that this lady hath conferred on me a benefit for which I am unable to
requite her; for she rescued me from death, by killing my enemy;
and I, having seen what her sisters had done to her, determined to
take vengeance upon them; therefore I transformed them by enchantment
into two bitches; and, indeed, I had wished rather to kill them,
fearing lest they should trouble her; but now, if thou desire their
restoration, O Prince of the Faithful, I will restore them, as a favour
to thee and to her; for I am one of the true believers.&mdash;Do so, said the
Khaleefeh; and then we will enter upon the consideration of the affair
of the lady who hath been beaten, and examine her case, and if her
veracity be established, I will take vengeance for her upon him who
hath oppressed her. The Jinneeyeh replied, O Prince of the Faithful,
I will guide thee to the discovery of him who acted thus to this lady,
and oppressed her, and took her property: he is thy nearest relation.
She then took a cup of water, and, having pronounced a spell over it,
sprinkled the faces of the two bitches, saying, Be restored to your
original human forms!&mdash;whereupon they became again two young
ladies.&mdash;Extolled be the perfection of their Creator!<a href="#III100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Having done
this, the Jinneeyeh said, O Prince of the Faithful, he who beat the
lady is thy son El-Emeen, who had heard of her beauty and loveliness:&mdash;and
she proceeded to relate what had happened. The Khaleefeh
was astonished, and exclaimed, Praise be to God for the restoration of
these two bitches which hath been effected through my means!&mdash;and
immediately he summoned before him his son El-Emeen, and inquired
of him the history of the lady; and he related to him the truth. He
then sent for &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ees and witnesses, and the first lady and her two
sisters who had been transformed into bitches he married to the three
mendicants who had related that they were the sons of Kings; and
these he made chamberlains of his court, appointing them all that they
required, and allotting them apartments in the palace of Baghd&aacute;d.
The lady who had been beaten he restored to his son El-Emeen,
giving her a large property, and ordering that the house should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
rebuilt in a more handsome style. Lastly, the lady-cateress he took
as his own wife; he admitted her at once to his own apartment, and,
on the following day, he appointed her a separate lodging for herself,
with female slaves to wait upon her: he also allotted to her a regular
income; and afterwards built for her a palace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III1" id="III1">1.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Uses of Palm-sticks in various Manufactures.</i> The kind of crate here
mentioned is made of jereeds, or palm-sticks, which (being very soft, and easily cut and
punched, in their fresh state, and very tough, difficult to break, and light, when dry,)
are used in a great variety of manufactures. In making crates or baskets, and stools,
bed-frames, coops, &amp;c., a number of jereeds, being placed an inch or more apart, are
fixed by two, three, or more, thicker ones, placed transversely. Round holes are
punched in the latter, through which the former are inserted; and the whole becomes
light and strong as soon as it is dry. Chests are made with thick jereeds placed close
together, and others, pared thin, passing transversely through them.</p>

worn by them when they appear in public. It is about two yards or more in width (according
to the height of the wearer), and three yards in length: one edge of it being
drawn from behind, over the upper part of the head and the forehead, and secured by a
band sewed inside, the rest hangs down behind and on each side to the ground, or nearly
so, and almost entirely envelops the person; the two ends being held so as nearly to meet
in front. Thus it conceals every other part of the dress excepting a small portion of a
very loose gown (which is another of the articles of walking or riding apparel), and
the face-veil. It is now generally made of white calico, but a similar covering of black
silk for the married, and of white silk for the unmarried, is now worn by females of the
higher and middle classes, and is called a "&#7717;abarah."</p>

<p>It appears that the kind of face-veil mentioned in the same passage (in Arabic,
"&#7731;in&aacute;&#7841;,") is a piece of muslin, about a yard or more in length, and somewhat less in
width, a portion of which is placed over the head, beneath the iz&aacute;r, the rest hanging
down in front, to the waist, or thereabout, and entirely concealing the face. I have
often seen Arab women, particularly those of the Wahh&aacute;bees, wearing veils of this kind
composed of printed muslin, completely concealing their features, yet of sufficiently
loose fabric to admit of their seeing their way. But the more common kind of Arab
face-veil is a long strip of white muslin, or of a kind of black crape, covering the whole
of the face excepting the eyes, and reaching nearly to the feet. It is suspended at the
top by a narrow band, which passes up the forehead, and which is sewed, as are also
the two upper corners of the veil, to a band that is tied round the head. This veil is
called "bur&#7731;o'." The black kind is often ornamented with gold coins, false pearls, &amp;c.,
attached to the upper part. It is not so genteel as the white veil, unless for a lady in
mourning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III3" id="III3">3.</a></span> "El-M&oacute;&#7779;il" is the name of the city which Europeans commonly call
"Mosul," "Mosoul," &amp;c.; a city long famous for its fine stuffs. Hence our word
"muslin," often termed, in Arabic, "M&oacute;&#7779;ilee," signifying, "of the manufacture of El-M&oacute;&#7779;il."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III4" id="III4">4.</a></span> The wine is mentioned in the Calcutta edition of the first two hundred
nights, but not in the edition of Cairo. The lady went to a Christian to purchase her
wine because Muslims are not allowed to sell it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III5" id="III5">5.</a></span> The "'Othm&aacute;nee quinces" I suppose to be a kind so called after some
person named 'Othm&aacute;n who introduced it, or was famous for its culture. The term
"Sul&#7789;&aacute;nee," applied to the citrons afterwards mentioned, signifies "imperial."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III6" id="III6">6.</a></span> A list of these sweets is given in my original, but I have thought it better
to omit the names.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III7" id="III7">7.</a></span> The "willow-flower-water" is prepared from the sweet-scented flowers of
the Oriental willow, called "b&aacute;n" and "khil&aacute;f" or "khal&aacute;f;" a twig of which is, among
the Arabs, a favourite emblem of a graceful female.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III8" id="III8">8.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Vessels used for Sprinkling and Perfuming.</i> The sprinkling-bottle,
here called "mirashsh," is more commonly called "&#7731;um&#7731;um," and has been alluded to
in a former note, as having a spherical or wide body, and a long and narrow neck. It
is generally about eight inches high, and of plain or gilt silver, or of fine brass, or china,
or glass; and has a cover pierced with a small hole. This vessel is used in the houses
of the rich to sprinkle a guest or visiter, before he rises to take his leave, with rose-water;
after which ceremony, a page or servant presents to him a kind of censer, called
"mibkharah," which is generally of one or other of the metals above mentioned, and
about the same height as the &#7731;um&#7731;um; and he wafts the smoke which rises from it
towards his face, beard, &amp;c., with the right hand. The body of the mibkharah, the
form of which is nearly globular, surmounts a stem rising from the centre of a small
circular tray; the upper half is a cover pierced with apertures for the escape of the
smoke; and the lower half, in which some burning charcoal is placed, is lined, or half
filled, with gypsum-plaster. Aloes-wood, previously moistened, or some other odoriferous
substance, is placed upon the burning coals; and sometimes, in the houses of very
wealthy persons, ambergris is used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III9" id="III9">9.</a></span> This description of the outer door of a house in Baghd&aacute;d is an obvious
absurdity; but none of the copies of the original to which I have access authorizes my
substituting "gilt" for "plated with gold;" all here agreeing in the use of words
which have the latter sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III10" id="III10">10.</a></span> In their eagerness to obtain the earliest possible sight of the new moon
which marks the period of the commencement of the Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, lest they should not
begin their fast as soon as the law requires, the Muslims often see the crescent one night
earlier in this than in any other month. The comparison of an eyebrow to the new
moon of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n expresses, therefore, its extreme thinness, as well as its arched form.
To reduce its natural thickness, and to give it this form, scissors are often used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III11" id="III11">11.</a></span> "The seal of Suleym&aacute;n" is a name given by the Arabs to a six-pointed
star formed by two equilateral triangles intersecting each other, and to the flower which
we, also, call "Solomon's seal." I fear that the reader will not consider the comparison
very apposite, unless the allusion be to a beautiful red berry which, I am informed, is
borne by the flower here mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III12" id="III12">12.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Description of Apartments in Arab Houses.</i> Most of the descriptions of
interior domestic architecture which occur in the present work, I may aptly illustrate
by availing myself of observations made in Cairo. In the houses of persons of the
higher and middle classes in this city, the different apartments generally resemble each
other in several respects, and are similarly furnished. The greater portion of the floor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
is elevated about half a foot, or somewhat more, above the rest. The higher portion is
called "leew&aacute;n" (a corruption of "el-eew&aacute;n"), and the lower, "dur&#7731;&aacute;'ah," from the
Persian "dar-g&aacute;h." When there is but one leew&aacute;n, the dur&#7731;&aacute;'ah occupies the lower
end, extending from the door to the opposite wall. In a handsome house, it is usually
paved with white and black marble, and little pieces of red tile, inlaid in tasteful
and complicated patterns; and if the room is on the ground-floor, and sometimes in
other cases, it has, in the centre, a fountain which plays into a small, shallow pool, lined
with coloured marbles, &amp;c., like the surrounding pavement. The shoes, or slippers, are
left upon the dur&#7731;&aacute;'ah previously to stepping upon the leew&aacute;n. The latter is generally
paved with common stone, and covered with a mat in summer, and a carpet over this
in winter; and a mattress and cushions are placed against each of its three walls, composing
what is called a "deew&aacute;n," or divan. The mattress, which is commonly about
three feet wide, and three or four inches thick, is placed either on the floor or on a
raised frame or a slightly-elevated pavement; and the cushions, which are usually of
a length equal to the width of the mattress, and of a height equal to half that measure,
lean against the wall. Both mattresses and cushions are stuffed with cotton, and
are covered with printed calico, cloth, or some more expensive stuff. The deew&aacute;n
which extends along the upper end of the leew&aacute;n is called the "&#7779;adr," and is the most
honourable: and the chief place on this seat is the corner which is to the right of a
person facing this end of the room; the other corner is the next in point of honour;
and the intermediate places on the same deew&aacute;n are more honourable than those on the
two side-deew&aacute;ns. To a superior, and often to an equal, the master or mistress yields
the chief place. The corners are often furnished with an additional mattress, of a square
form, just large enough for one person, placed upon the other mattress, and with two
additional (but smaller) cushions to recline against. The walls are, for the most part,
plastered and white-washed, and generally have two or more shallow cupboards, the
doors of which, as well as those of the apartments, are fancifully constructed with small
panels. The windows, which are chiefly composed of curious wooden lattice-work,
serving to screen the inhabitants from the view of persons without, as also to admit
both light and air, commonly project outwards, and are furnished with mattresses and
cushions. In many houses there are, above these, small windows of coloured glass,
representing bunches of flowers, &amp;c. The ceiling is of wood, and certain portions of it,
which are carved, or otherwise ornamented by fanciful carpentry, are usually painted
with bright colours, such as red, green, and blue, and sometimes varied with gilding;
but the greater part of the wood-work is generally left unpainted.</p>

<p>The word in the original text which I translate "saloon," is "&#7731;&aacute;'ah." This term
is applied to a large and lofty apartment, commonly having two leew&aacute;ns, on opposite
sides of the dur&#7731;&aacute;'ah. One of these is, in most instances, larger than the other, and is
held to be the more honourable part. Some &#7731;&aacute;'ahs, containing three leew&aacute;ns, one of
these being opposite the entrance, or four leew&aacute;ns composing the form of a cross with
the dur&#7731;&aacute;'ah in the centre, communicate with small chambers or closets, or have
elevated recesses which are furnished in the same manner as the leew&aacute;ns. That part of
the roof which is over the dur&#7731;&aacute;'ah rises above the rest, sometimes to nearly twice the
height of the latter, and is generally surmounted by a lantern of wooden lattice-work
to admit the air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III13" id="III13">13.</a></span> In the Cairo edition, the couch is described as being in the <i>midst</i> of the
saloon; but this is inconsistent with what follows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III14" id="III14">14.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Of</i> B&aacute;bil, <i>and the Angels</i> H&aacute;root <i>and</i> M&aacute;root. B&aacute;bil, or Babel, is regarded
by the Muslims as the fountain-head of the science of magic, which was, and, as most
think, still is, taught there to mankind by two fallen angels, named H&aacute;root and
M&aacute;root,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> who are there suspended by the feet in a great pit closed by a mass of rock.</p>

<p>According to the account of them generally received as correct, these two angels, in
consequence of their want of compassion for the frailties of mankind, were rendered, by
God, susceptible of human passions, and sent down upon the earth to be tempted: they
both sinned; and, being permitted to choose whether they would be punished in this
life or in the other, chose the former; but they were sent down not merely to <i>experience</i>
temptation, being also appointed to tempt others by means of their knowledge of
magic; though it appears that they were commanded not to teach this art to any man
"until they had said, Verily we are a temptation; therefore, be not an unbeliever."<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>-&#8211;The
celebrated traditionist Muj&aacute;hid is related to have visited them, under the guidance
of a Jew. Having removed the mass of rock from the mouth of the pit, or well, they
entered. Muj&aacute;hid had been previously charged by the Jew not to mention the name
of God in their presence; but when he beheld them, resembling in size two huge mountains,
and suspended upside-down, with irons attached to their necks and knees, he
could not refrain from uttering the forbidden name; whereupon the two angels became
so violently agitated that they almost broke the irons which confined them, and
Muj&aacute;hid and his guide fled back in consternation.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n El-Mu-eiyad, in the early part of the ninth century of the Flight, or of
the fifteenth of our era. In the Calcutta edition of the first two hundred nights, and
in the edition of Breslau, we read here "two dirhems," instead of
"two nu&#7779;fs." [The

here pass over an extremely objectionable scene, which, it is to be hoped, would convey a
very erroneous idea of the manners of Arab <i>ladies</i>; though I have witnessed, at private
festivities in Cairo, abominable scenes, of which ladies, screened behind lattices, were
spectators. Can the same be said with respect to the previous carousal? This is a
question which cannot be answered in a few words.</p>

<p>The prohibition of wine, or, rather, of fermented and intoxicating liquors, being one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>of the most remarkable and important points of the Mohammadan religion, it might
be imagined that the frequent stories in this work, describing parties of Muslims as
habitually indulging in the use of forbidden beverages, are scandalous misrepresentations
of Arab manners and customs. There are, however, many similar anecdotes
interspersed in the works of Arab historians, which (though many of them are probably
untrue in their application to particular individuals) could not have been offered to the
public by such writers if they were not of a nature consistent with the customs of a
considerable class of the Arab nation.</p>

<p>In investigating this subject, it is necessary, in the first place, to state, that there is
a kind of wine which Muslims are permitted to drink. It is properly called "nebeedh"
(a name which is <i>now</i> given to <i>prohibited</i> kinds of wine), and is generally prepared by
putting dry grapes, or dry dates, in water, to extract their sweetness, and suffering the
liquor to ferment slightly, until it acquires a little sharpness or pungency. The Prophet
himself was in the habit of drinking wine of this kind, which was prepared for him in
the first part of the night; he drank it on the first and second days following; but if
any remained on the morning of the third day, he either gave it to his servants or
ordered it to be poured out upon the ground.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> Such beverages have, therefore, been
drunk by the strictest of his followers; and Ibn-Khaldoon strongly argues that nebeedh
thus prepared from dates was the kind of wine used by the Khaleefehs H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed
and El-Ma-moon, and several other eminent men, who have been commonly
accused of habitually and publicly indulging in debauches of wine properly so called;
that is, of inebriating liquors.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>Nebeedh, prepared from raisins, is commonly sold in Arab towns, under the name of
"zebeeb," which signifies "raisins." This I have often drunk in Cairo; but never
could perceive that it was in the slightest degree fermented. Other beverages, to
which the name of "nebeedh" has been applied (though, like zebeeb, no longer called
by that name), are also sold in Arab towns. The most common of these is an infusion
of licorice, and called by the name of the root, "'er&#7731;-soos." The nebeedh of dates is
sold in Cairo with the dates themselves in the liquor; and in like manner is that of
figs. Under the same appellation of "nebeedh" have been classed the different kinds
of beer now commonly called "boozeh," which have been mentioned in former pages.
Opium, hemp, &amp;c., are now more frequently used by the Muslims to induce intoxication
or exhilaration. The young leaves of the hemp are generally used alone, or mixed with
tobacco, for smoking; and the capsules, without the seeds, enter into the composition
of several intoxicating conserves. Some remarks upon this subject have been inserted
in a former note.</p>

<p>By my own experience I am but little qualified to pronounce an opinion respecting
the prevalence of drinking wine among the Arabs; for, never drinking it myself, I had
little opportunity of observing others do so during my residence among Muslims. I
judge, therefore, from the conversations and writings of Arabs, which justify me in
asserting that the practice of drinking wine in private, and by select parties, is far from
being uncommon among modern Muslims, though certainly more so than it was before
the introduction of tobacco into the East, in the beginning of the seventeenth century
of our era; for this herb, being in a slight degree exhilarating, and at the same time
soothing, and unattended by the injurious effects that result from wine, is a sufficient
luxury to many who, without it, would have recourse to intoxicating beverages merely
to pass away hours of idleness. The use of coffee, too, which became common in Egypt,
Syria, and other countries, besides Arabia, a century earlier than tobacco, doubtless
tended to render the habit of drinking wine less general. That it was adopted as a
substitute for wine appears even from its name, "&#7731;ahweh," an old Arabic term for
wine; whence the Turkish "&#7731;ahveh," the Italian "caffe," and our "coffee."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>
<p>There is an Arabic work of some celebrity, and not of small extent, entitled "&#7716;albet
el-Kumeyt,"<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> apparently written shortly before the Arabs were in possession of the first
of the above-mentioned substitutes for wine, nearly the whole of which consists of
anecdotes and verses relating to the pleasures resulting from, or attendant upon, the
use of wine; a few pages at the end being devoted to the condemnation of this practice,
or, in other words, to prove the worthlessness of all that precedes. Of this work I
possess a copy, a quarto volume of 464 pages. I have endeavoured to skim its cream;
but found it impossible to do so without collecting, at the same time, a considerable
quantity of most filthy scum; for it is characterised by wit and humour plentifully
interlarded with the grossest and most revolting obscenity; yet it serves to confirm
what has been above asserted. The mere existence of such a work (and it is not the
only one of the kind), written by a man of learning, and I believe a &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee, a judge, or
one holding the honourable office of a guardian of religion and morality,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>&mdash;written, too,
evidently with pleasure, notwithstanding his assertion to the contrary,&mdash;is a strong argument
in favour of the prevalence of the practice which it paints in the most fascinating
colours, and then condemns. Its author terminates a chapter (the ninth), in which many
well-known persons are mentioned as having been addicted to wine, by saying, that the
Khaleefehs, Emeers, and Wezeers, so addicted, are too numerous to name in such a
work; and by relating a story of a man who placed his own wife in pledge in the
hands of a wine-merchant, after having expended in the purchase of the forbidden
liquor all the property that he possessed. He excuses himself (in his preface) for
writing this book, by saying that he had been ordered to do so by one whom he could
not disobey; thus giving us a pretty strong proof that a great man in his time was not
ashamed of avowing his fondness for the prohibited enjoyment. If, then, we admit the
respectable authority of Ibn-Khaldoon, and acquit of the vice of drunkenness those
illustrious individuals whose characters he vindicates, we must still regard most of the
anecdotes relating to the carousals of other persons as being not without foundation.</p>

<p>One of my friends, who enjoys a high reputation, ranking among the most distinguished
of the 'Ulam&agrave; of Cairo, is well known to his intimate acquaintances as
frequently indulging in the use of forbidden beverages with a few select associates. I
disturbed him and his companions by an evening visit on one of these occasions, and
was kept waiting within the street-door while the guests quickly removed everything
that would give me any indication of the manner in which they had been employed;
for the announcement of my (assumed) name, and their knowledge of my abstemious
character, completely disconcerted them. I found them, however, in the best humour.
They had contrived, it appeared, to fill with wine a <i>china</i> bottle, of the kind used at
that season (winter) for water; and when any one of them asked the servant for water,
this bottle was brought to him; but when I made the same demand, my host told me
that there was a bottle of water on the sill of the window behind that part of the
deew&aacute;n upon which I was seated. The evening passed away very pleasantly, and I
should not have known how unwelcome was my intrusion had not one of the guests
with whom I was intimately acquainted, in walking part of the way home with me,
explained to me the whole occurrence. There was with us a third person, who, thinking
that my antipathy to wine was feigned, asked me to stop at his house on my way, and
take a cup of "white coffee," by which he meant brandy.</p>

<p>Another of my Muslim acquaintances in Cairo I frequently met at the house of a
mutual friend, where, though he was in most respects very bigoted, he was in the habit
of indulging in wine. For some time he refrained from this gratification when I was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
present; but at length my presence became so irksome to him, that he ventured to
enter into an argument with me on the subject of the prohibition. The only answer I
could give to his question, "Why is wine forbidden?"&mdash;was in the words of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n,
"Because it is the source of more evil than profit."<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> This suited his purpose, as I
intended it should; and he asked, "What evil results from it?" I answered, "Intoxication
and quarrels, &amp;c."&mdash;"Then," said he, "if a man take not enough to intoxicate
him there is no harm;"&mdash;and finding that I acquiesced by silence, he added, "I am in
the habit of taking a little; but never enough to intoxicate. Boy, bring me a glass."&mdash;He
was the only Muslim, however, whom I have heard to argue against the absolute
interdiction of inebriating liquors.</p>

<p>Histories tell us that some of the early followers of the Prophet indulged in wine,
holding the text above referred to as indecisive; and that Mo&#7717;ammad was at first
doubtful upon this subject appears from another text, in which his followers were told
not to come to prayer when they were drunk, until they should know what they would
say;<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> an injunction somewhat similar to one in the Bible;<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> but when frequent and
severe contentions resulted from their use of wine, the following more decided condemnation
of the practice was pronounced:&mdash;"O ye who have become believers, verily
wine and lots and images and divining-arrows are an abomination of the work of the
Devil; therefore, avoid them, that ye may prosper."<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> This law is absolute: its violation
in the smallest degree is criminal. The punishment ordained by the law for
drinking (or, according to most doctors, for even tasting) wine or spirits, or inducing
intoxication by any other means, on ordinary occasions, is the infliction of eighty stripes
in the case of a free man, and forty in that of a slave; but if the crime be openly committed
in the course of any day of the month of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, when others are fasting, the
punishment prescribed is death!</p>

<p>The prohibition of wine hindered many of the Prophet's contemporaries from
embracing his religion. It is said that the famous poet El-A&#7841;sh&agrave;, who was one of
them, delayed to join his cause on this account, until death prevented him. A person
passing by his tomb (at Menfoo&#7717;&aacute;h, in El-Yem&aacute;meh), and observing that it was moist,
asked the reason, and was answered, that the young men of the place, considering him
still as their cup-companion, drank wine over his grave, and poured his cup upon it.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>
Yet many of the most respectable of the pagan Arabs, like certain of the Jews and
early Christians, abstained totally from wine, from a feeling of its injurious effects upon
morals, and, in their climate, upon health; or, more especially, from the fear of being
led by it into the commission of foolish and degrading actions. Thus, &#7730;eys the son of
'&Aacute;&#7779;im, being one night overcome with wine, attempted to grasp the moon, and swore
that he would not quit the spot where he stood until he had laid hold of it: after
leaping several times with the view of doing so, he fell flat upon his face; and when he
recovered his senses, and was acquainted with the cause of his face being bruised, he
made a solemn vow to abstain from wine ever after.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> A similar feeling operated upon
many Muslims more than religious principle. The Khaleefeh 'Abd-El-Melik Ibn-Marw&aacute;n
took pleasure in the company of a slave named Na&#7779;eeb, and one day desired
him to drink with him. The slave replied, "O Prince of the Faithful, I am not related
to thee, nor have I any authority over thee, and I am of no rank or lineage: I am a
black slave, and my wit and politeness have drawn me into thy favour: how then shall
I take that which will plunder me of these two qualities; and by what shall I then
propitiate thee?" The Khaleefeh admired and excused him.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>It was the custom of many Muslim princes, as might be inferred from the above
anecdote, to admit the meanest of their dependants to participate in their unlawful
carousals when they could have no better companions; but poets and musicians were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
their more common associates on these occasions; and these two classes, and especially
the latter, are in the present day the most addicted to intoxicating liquors. Few modern
Arab musicians are so well contented with extraordinary payment and mere sweet
sherbet as with a moderate fee and plenty of wine and brandy; and many of them
deem even wine but a sorry beverage.</p>

<p>It was usual with the host and guests at wine-parties to wear dresses of bright
colours, red, yellow, and green;<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> and to perfume their beards and mustaches with
civet, or to have rose-water sprinkled upon them; and ambergris or aloes-wood, or
some other odoriferous substance, placed upon burning coals in a censer, diffused a
delicious fragrance throughout the saloon of the revels.</p>

<p>The wine, it appears, was rather thick; for it was necessary to strain it:<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> it was
probably sweet, and not strong; for it was drunk in large quantities. Frequently,
perhaps, it was nebeedh of dry raisins kept longer than the law allows. It was usually
kept in a large earthen vessel, called "denn," high, and small at the bottom, which was
partly imbedded in the earth to keep it upright. The name of this vessel is now given
to a cask of wood; but the kind above mentioned was of earth; for it was easily broken.&mdash;A
famous saint, Abu-l-&#7716;oseyn En-Nooree, seeing a vessel on the Tigris containing
thirty denns belonging to the Khaleefeh El-Mo&#7841;ta&#7693;id, and being told that they contained
wine, took a boat-pole, and broke them all, excepting one. When brought before
the Khaleefeh to answer for this action, and asked by him, "Who made thee Mo&#7717;tesib?"<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
he boldly answered, "He who made thee Khaleefeh!"&mdash;and was pardoned.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>&mdash;Pitch
was used by the Arabs, as it was by the Greeks and Romans, for the purpose of
curing their wine; the interior of the denn being coated with it. A smaller kind of
earthen jar, or amphora,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> and a bottle of leather,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> or of glass,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> were also used. The
wine was transferred for the table to glass jugs, or long-spouted ewers.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> These and
the cups were placed upon a round embroidered cloth spread on the floor, or upon a
round tray. The latter now is in general use, and is supported on a low stool, described
in a former note, as being used at ordinary meals. The guests sat around, reclining
against pillars; or they sat upon the deew&aacute;n, and a page or slave handed the cup,
having on his right arm a richly-embroidered napkin: the person after drinking took
the end of this to wipe his lips. The cups are often described as holding a fluid pound,
or little less than an English pint; and this is to be understood literally, or nearly so:
they were commonly of cut glass; but some were of crystal, or silver, or gold.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> With
these and the ewers or jugs were placed several saucers, or small dishes,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> of fresh and
dried fruits;<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> and fans and fly-whisks, of the kinds described on a former occasion,
were used by the guests.</p>

<p>The most common and esteemed fruits in the countries inhabited by the Arabs may
here be mentioned.</p>

<p>The date<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> deserves the first place. The Prophet's favourite fruits were fresh
dates<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> and water-melons; and he ate them both together.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> "Honour," said he, "your
paternal aunt, the date-palm; for she was created of the earth of which Adam was
formed."<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> It is said that God hath given this tree as a peculiar favour to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>Muslims; that he hath decreed all the date-palms in the world to them, and they have
accordingly conquered every country in which these trees are found; and all are said
to have derived their origin from the Hej&aacute;z.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> The palm-tree has several well-known
properties that render it an emblem of a human being; among which are these; that
if the head be cut off, the tree dies; and if a branch be cut off, another does not grow
in its place.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> Dates are preserved in a moist state by being merely pressed together
in a basket or skin, and thus prepared are called "'ajweh." There are many varieties
of this fruit. The pith or heart of the palm<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> is esteemed for its delicate flavour.</p>

<p>The water-melon,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> from what has been said of it above, ought to be ranked next;
and it really merits this distinction. "Whoso eateth," said the Prophet, "a mouthful
of water-melon, God writeth for him a thousand good works, and cancelleth a thousand
evil works, and raiseth him a thousand degrees; for it came from Paradise;"&mdash;and
again, "The water-melon is food and drink, acid and alkali, and a support of life," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
The varieties of this fruit are very numerous.</p>

<p>The banana<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> is a delicious fruit. The Prophet pronounced the banana-tree to be
the only thing on earth that resembles a thing in Paradise; because it bears fruit both
in winter and summer.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>The pomegranate<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> is another celebrated fruit. Every pomegranate, according to
the Prophet, contains a fecundating seed from Paradise.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>The other most common and esteemed fruits are the following:&mdash;the apple, pear,
quince, apricot, peach, fig, sycamore-fig, grape, lote, jujube, plum, walnut, almond,
hazel-nut, pistachio-nut, orange, Seville-orange, lime and lemon, citron, mulberry, olive,
and sugar-cane.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>Of a selection of these fruits consists the dessert which accompanies the wine; but
the table is not complete without a bunch or two of flowers placed in the midst.</p>

<p>Though the Arabs are far from being remarkable for exhibiting taste in the
planning of their gardens, they are passionately fond of flowers, and especially of the
rose.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>&mdash;The Khaleefeh El-Mutawekkil monopolized roses for his own enjoyment;
saying, "I am the King of Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns, and the rose is the king of sweet-scented flowers;
therefore each of us is most worthy of the other for a companion." The rose, in his
time, was seen nowhere but in his palace: during the season of this flower he wore
rose-coloured clothes; and his carpets, &amp;c., were sprinkled with rose-water.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> A similar
passion for the rose is said to have distinguished a weaver, in the reign of El-Ma-moon.
He was constantly employed at his loom every day of the year, even during the congregational
prayers of Friday, excepting in the rose-season, when he abandoned his
work, and gave himself up to the enjoyment of wine, early in the morning and late in
the evening, loudly proclaiming his revels by singing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The season has become pleasant! The time of the rose has come! Take your morning potations, as long as the rose has blossoms and flowers!"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When he resumed his work, he made it known by singing aloud,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If my Lord prolong my life until the rose-season, I will take again my morning potations: but if I die before it, alas! for the loss of the rose and wine!</span>
<span class="i0">"I implore the God of the supreme throne, whose glory be extolled, that my heart may continually enjoy the evening potations to the day of resurrection."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>
<p>&mdash;The Khaleefeh was so amused with the humour of this man, that he granted him an
annual pension of ten thousand dirhems to enable him to enjoy himself amply on these
occasions.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>&mdash;Another anecdote may be added to shew the estimation of the rose in the
mind of an Arab. It is said that Row&#7717; Ibn-&#7716;&aacute;tim, the governor of the province of
Northern Africa, was sitting one day, with a female slave, in an apartment of his
palace, when a eunuch brought him a jar full of red and white roses, which a man had
offered as a present. He ordered the eunuch to fill the jar with silver in return; but
his concubine said, "O my lord, thou hast not acted equitably towards the man; for
his present to thee is of two colours, red and white." The Emeer replied, "Thou
hast said truly;" and gave orders to fill the jar for him with silver and gold (dirhems
and deen&aacute;rs) intermixed.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>&mdash;Some persons preserve roses during the whole of the year,
in the following manner. They take a number of rose-buds, and fill with them a new
earthen jar, and, after closing its mouth with mud, so as to render it impervious to the
air, bury it in the earth. Whenever they want a few roses, they take out some of these
buds, which they find unaltered, sprinkle a little water upon them, and leave them for
a short time in the air, when they open, and appear as if just gathered.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>&mdash;The rose is
even a subject of miracles. It is related by Ibn-&#7730;uteybeh, that there grows in India a
kind of rose upon the leaves of which is inscribed, "There is no deity but God."<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> But
I find a more particular account of this miraculous rose. A person, who professed to
have seen it, said, "I went into India, and I saw, at one of its towns, a large rose,
sweet-scented, upon which was inscribed, in white characters, 'There is no deity but
God; Mo&#7717;ammad is God's apostle: Aboo-Bekr is the very veracious: 'Omar is the discriminator;'
and I doubted of this, whether it had been done by art; so I took one of
the blossoms not yet opened, and in it was the same inscription; and there were many
of the same kind there. The people of that place worshipped stones, and knew not
God, to whom be ascribed might and glory."<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>&mdash;Roses are announced for sale in the
streets of Cairo by the cry of "The rose was a thorn: from the sweat of the Prophet it
blossomed!" in allusion to a miracle recorded of Mo&#7717;ammad. "When I was taken up
into heaven," said the Prophet, "some of my sweat fell upon the earth, and from it
sprang the rose; and whoever would smell my scent, let him smell the rose." In
another tradition it is said, "The white rose was created from my sweat on the night
of the Me&#7841;r&aacute;j;<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> and the red rose, from the sweat of Jebraeel;<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> and the yellow rose,
from the sweat of El-Bur&aacute;&#7731;."<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>&mdash;The Persians take especial delight in roses; sometimes
spreading them as carpets or beds on which to sit or recline in their revellings.</p>

<p>But there is a flower pronounced more excellent than the rose; that of the Egyptian
privet, or Lawsonia inermis.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> Mo&#7717;ammad said, "The chief of the sweet-scented
flowers of this world and of the next is the f&aacute;ghiyeh;" and this was his favourite flower.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>
I approve of his taste; for this flower, which grows in clusters somewhat like those of
the lilac, has a most delicious fragrance. But, on account of discrepancies in different
traditions, a Muslim may, with a clear conscience, prefer either of the two flowers next
mentioned.</p>

<p>The Prophet said of the violet,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> "The excellence of the extract of violets, above
all other extracts, is as the excellence of me above all the rest of the creation: it is cold
in summer and hot in winter:" and, in another tradition, "The excellence of the violet
is as the excellence of El-Isl&aacute;m above all other religions."<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> A delicious sherbet is made
of a conserve of sugar and violet-flowers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>
<p>The myrtle<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> is the rival of the violet. "Adam," said the Prophet, "fell down from
Paradise with three things; the myrtle, which is the chief of
sweet-scented flowers in
this world; an ear of wheat, which is the chief of all kinds of food in this world; and
pressed dates, which are the chief of the fruits of this world."<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>The anemone<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> was monopolized for his own enjoyment by No&#7841;m&aacute;n Ibn-El-Mundhir
(King of El-&#7716;eereh, and contemporary of Mo&#7717;ammad), as the rose was afterwards
by El-Mutawekkil.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p>Another flower much admired and celebrated in the East is the gilliflower.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>
There are three principal kinds; the most esteemed is the yellow, or golden-coloured,
which has a delicious scent both by night and day; the next, the purple,
and other dark kinds, which have a scent only in the night; the least esteemed,
the white, which has no scent. The yellow gilliflower is an emblem of a neglected
lover.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>The narcissus<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> is very highly esteemed. Galen says, "He who has two cakes of
bread, let him dispose of one of them for some flowers of the narcissus; for bread is the
food of the body, and the narcissus is the food of the soul." Hippocrates, too, gave a
similar opinion.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>The following flowers complete the list of those celebrated as most appropriate
to add to the delights of wine:&mdash;the jasmine, eglantine, Seville-orange-flower, lily,
sweet-basil, wild thyme, buphthalmum, chamomile, nenuphar, lotus, pomegranate-flower,
poppy, ketmia, crocus or saffron, safflower, flax, the blossoms of different kinds
of bean, and those of the almond.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>A sprig of Oriental willow<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> adds much to the charms of a bunch of flowers, being
the favourite symbol of a graceful female.</p>

<p>But I have not yet mentioned all that contributes to the pleasures of an Eastern
carousal. For the juice of the grape is not fully relished without melodious sounds.
"Wine is as the body; music, as the soul; and joy is their offspring."<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> All the five
senses should be gratified. For this reason, an Arab toper, who had nothing, it appears,
but wine to enjoy, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ho! give me wine to drink; and tell me, 'This is wine.'"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>For, on drinking, his sight and smell and taste and touch would all be affected; but it
was desirable that his hearing should also be pleased.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>Music was condemned by the Prophet almost as severely as wine. "Singing and
hearing songs," said he, "cause hypocrisy to grow in the heart, like as water promoteth
the growth of corn:"<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>&mdash;and musical instruments he declared to be among the most
powerful means by which the Devil seduces man. An instrument of music is the
Devil's mu&euml;ddin, serving to call men to his worship, as stated in a former note. Of the
hypocrisy of those attached to music, the following anecdote presents an instance:&mdash;A
drunken young man with a lute in his hand was brought one night before the Khaleefeh
'Abd-El-Melik the son of Marw&aacute;n, who, pointing to the instrument, asked what it was,
and what was its use. The youth made no answer; so he asked those around him; but
they also remained silent, till one, more bold than the rest, said, "O Prince of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>Faithful, this is a lute: it is made by taking some wood of the pistachio-tree, and cutting
it into thin pieces, and glueing these together, and then attaching over them these
chords, which, when a beautiful girl touches them, send forth sounds more pleasant
than those of rain falling upon a desert land; and my wife is separated from me by a
triple divorce if every one in this council is not acquainted with it, and doth not know
it as well as I do, and thou the first of them, O Prince of the Faithful." The Khaleefeh
laughed, and ordered that the young man should be discharged.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>The latter saying of the Prophet, respecting the Devil, suggests to me the insertion
of another anecdote, related of himself by Ibr&aacute;heem El-M&oacute;&#7779;ilee, the father of Is-&#7717;&aacute;&#7731;;
both of whom were very celebrated musicians. I give a translation of it somewhat
abridged.&mdash;"I asked Er-Rasheed," says Ibr&aacute;heem, "to grant me permission to spend a
day at home with my female slaves and brothers; and he gave me two thousand
deen&aacute;rs, and appointed the next Saturday for this purpose. I caused the meats and
wine and other necessaries to be prepared, and ordered the chamberlain to close the
door, and admit no one: but while I was sitting, with my attendants standing in the
form of a curved line before me, there entered, and approached me, a sheykh, reverend
and dignified and comely in appearance, wearing short khuffs,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> and two soft gowns,
with a &#7731;alensuweh<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> upon his head, and in his hand a silver-headed staff; and sweet
odours were diffused from his clothes. I was enraged with the chamberlain for admitting
him; but on his saluting me in a very courteous manner, I returned his salutation,
and desired him to sit down. He then began to repeat to me stories, tales of war, and
poetry; so that my anger was appeased, and it appeared to me that my servants had
not presumed to admit him until acquainted with his politeness and courteousness; I
therefore said to him, 'Hast thou any inclination for meat?' He answered, 'I have no
want of it.'&mdash;'And the wine?' said I. He replied, 'Yes.' So I drank a large cupful,
and he did the same, and then said to me, 'O Ibr&aacute;heem, wilt thou let us hear some
specimen of thy art in which thou hast excelled the people of thy profession?' I was
angry at his words; but I made light of the matter, and, having taken the lute and
tuned it, I played and sang; whereupon he said, 'Thou hast performed well, O
Ibr&aacute;heem.' I became more enraged, and said within myself, 'He is not content with
coming hither without permission, and asking me to sing, but he calls me by my name,
and proves himself unworthy of my conversation.' He then said, 'Wilt thou let us
hear more? If so, we will requite thee.' And I took the lute, and sang, using my
utmost care, on account of his saying, 'we will requite thee.' He was moved with
delight, and said, 'Thou hast performed well, O my master Ibr&aacute;heem:'&mdash;adding, 'Wilt
thou permit thy slave to sing?' I answered, 'As thou pleasest:'&mdash;but thinking
lightly of his sense to sing after me. He took the lute, and tuned it; and, by Allah! I
imagined that the lute spoke in his hands with an eloquent Arab tongue. He proceeded
to sing some verses commencing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My heart is wounded! Who will give me, for it, a heart without a wound?'</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The narrator continues by saying, that he was struck dumb and motionless with
ecstasy; and that the strange sheykh, after having played and sung again, and taught
him an enchanting air (with which he afterwards enraptured his patron, the Khaleefeh),
vanished. Ibr&aacute;heem, in alarm, seized his sword; and was the more amazed when he
found that the porter had not seen the stranger enter or leave the house; but he heard
his voice again, outside, telling him that he was Aboo-Murrah (the Devil).<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>&mdash;Two
other anecdotes of a similar kind are related in the work from which the above is
taken.</p>

<p>Ibr&aacute;heem El-M&oacute;&#7779;ilee, his son Is-&#7717;&aacute;&#7731;, and Mukh&aacute;ri&#7731; (a pupil of the former), were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>especially celebrated among the Arab musicians, and among the distinguished men of
the reign of H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed. Is-&#7717;&aacute;&#7731; El-M&oacute;&#7779;ilee relates, of his father Ibr&aacute;heem,
that when Er-Rasheed took him into his service, he gave him a hundred and fifty thousand
dirhems, and allotted him a monthly pension of ten thousand dirhems, besides
occasional presents [one of which is mentioned as amounting to a hundred thousand
dirhems for a single song], and the produce of his (Ibr&aacute;heem's) farms: he had food
constantly prepared for him; three sheep every day for his kitchen, besides birds; three
thousand dirhems were allowed him for fruits, perfumes, &amp;c., every month, and a thousand
dirhems for his clothing; "and with all this," says his son, "he died without
leaving more than three thousand deen&aacute;rs, a sum not equal to his debts, which I paid
after his death."<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>&mdash;Ibr&aacute;heem was of Persian origin, and of a high family. He was
commonly called the Nedeem (or cup-companion), being Er-Rasheed's favourite companion
at the wine-table; and his son, who enjoyed the like distinction with El-Ma-moon,
received the same appellation, as well as that of "Son of the Nedeem."
Ibr&aacute;heem was the most famous musician of his time, at least till his son attained
celebrity.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<p>Is-&#7717;&aacute;&#7731; El-M&oacute;&#7779;ilee was especially famous as a musician; but he was also a good
poet, accomplished in general literature, and endowed with great wit. He was honoured
above all other persons in the pay of El-Ma-moon, and enjoyed a long life; but for
many years before his death he was blind.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>Mukh&aacute;ri&#7731; appears to have rivalled his master Ibr&aacute;heem. The latter, he relates,
took him to perform before Er-Rasheed, who used to have a curtain suspended between
him and the musicians. "Others," he says, "sang, and he was unmoved; but when I
sang, he came forth from behind the curtain, and exclaimed, 'Young man, hither!'
and he seated me upon the sereer [a kind of couch], and gave me thirty thousand
dirhems."<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> The following anecdote (which I abridge a little in translation) shews his
excellence in the art which he professed, and the effect of melody on an Arab:&mdash;"After
drinking with the Khaleefeh<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> a whole night, I asked his permission," says he, "to
take the air in the Ru&#7779;&aacute;feh,<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> which he granted; and while I was walking there, I saw
a damsel who appeared as if the rising sun beamed from her face. She had a basket,
and I followed her. She stopped at a fruiterer's, and bought some fruit; and observing
that I was following her, she looked back and abused me several times; but still I
followed her until she arrived at a great door, after having filled her basket with fruits
and flowers and similar things. When she had entered, and the door was closed behind
her, I sat down opposite to it, deprived of my reason by her beauty; and knew that
there must be in the house a wine-party. The sun went down upon me while I sat
there; and at length there came two handsome young men on asses, and they knocked
at the door, and when they were admitted I entered with them; the master of the
house thinking that I was their companion, and they imagining that I was one of
his friends. A repast was brought, and we ate, and washed our hands, and were
perfumed. The master of the house then said to the two young men, 'Have ye any
desire that I should call such a one?' (mentioning a female name). They answered,
'If thou wilt grant us the favour, well:'&mdash;so he called for her, and she came, and lo, she
was the maiden whom I had seen before, and who had abused me. A servant-maid
preceded her, bearing her lute, which she placed in her lap. Wine was then brought,
and she sang while we drank, and shook with delight. 'Whose air is that?' they
asked. She answered, 'Seedee<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> Mukh&aacute;ri&#7731;'s.' She then sang another air, which, also,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>she said was mine; while they drank by pints; she looking aside and doubtfully at me
until I lost my patience, and called out to her to do her best: but in attempting to do
so, singing a third air, she overstrained her voice, and I said, 'Thou hast made a
mistake:'&mdash;upon which she threw the lute from her lap, in anger, so that she nearly
broke it; saying, 'Take it thyself, and let us hear thee.' I answered, 'Well;' and,
having taken it and tuned it perfectly, sang the first of the airs which she had sung
before me; whereupon all of them sprang upon their feet, and kissed my head. I then
sang the second air, and the third; and their reason almost fled, from ecstasy. The
master of the house, after asking his guests, and being told by them that they knew
me not, came to me, and, kissing my hand, said, 'By Allah, my master, who art thou?'
I answered, 'By Allah, I am the singer Mukh&aacute;ri&#7731;.'&mdash;'And for what purpose,' said he,
kissing both my hands, 'camest thou hither?' I replied, 'As a spunger;'&mdash;and related
what had happened with respect to the maiden: whereupon he looked towards his two
companions, and said to them, 'Tell me, by Allah, do ye not know that I gave for that
girl thirty thousand dirhems, and have refused to sell her?' They answered, 'It is
so.' Then said he, 'I take you as witnesses that I have given her to him.'&mdash;'And
we,' said the two friends, 'will pay thee two-thirds of her price.' So he put me in
possession of the girl, and in the evening, when I departed, he presented me also with
rich dresses and other gifts, with all of which I went away; and as I passed the places
where the maiden had abused me, I said to her, 'Repeat thy words to me;' but she
could not, for shame. Holding the girl's hand, I went with her immediately to the
Khaleefeh, whom I found in anger at my long absence; but when I related my story
to him he was surprised, and laughed, and ordered that the master of the house and his
two friends should be brought before him, that he might requite them: to the former
he gave forty thousand dirhems; to each of his two friends, thirty thousand; and to
me, a hundred thousand; and I kissed his feet, and departed."<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>It is particularly necessary for the Arab musician, that he have a retentive memory,
well stocked with choice pieces of poetry, and with facetious or pleasant anecdotes,
interspersed with songs; and that he have a ready wit, aided by dramatic talent, to
employ these materials with good effect. If, to such qualifications, he adds fair attainments
in the difficult rules of grammar, a degree of eloquence, comic humour, and good
temper, and is not surpassed by many in his art, he is sure to be a general favourite.
Very few Muslims of the higher classes have condescended to study music, because they
would have been despised by their inferiors for doing so; or because they themselves
have despised or condemned the art. Ibr&aacute;heem, the son of the Khaleefeh El-Mahdee,
and competitor of El-Ma-moon, was a remarkable exception: he is said to have been
an excellent musician, and a good singer.</p>

<p>In the houses of the wealthy, the vocal and instrumental performers were usually
(as is the case in many houses in the present age) domestic female slaves, well instructed
in their art by hired male or female professors. In the work before us, these slaves
are commonly described as standing or sitting unveiled in the presence of male guests;
but, from several descriptions of musical entertainments that I have met with in
Arabic works, it appears that, according to the more approved custom in respectable
society, they were concealed on such occasions behind a curtain, which generally closed
the front of an elevated recess. In all the houses of wealthy Arabs that I have
entered, one or each of the larger saloons has an elevated closet, the front of which is
closed by a screen of wooden lattice-work, to serve as an orchestra for the domestic or
hired female singers and instrumental performers. Of the hired performers, any
further mention is not here required; but of the slaves and free ladies who supplied
their place, a few words must be added, as very necessary to illustrate the preceding
and many other tales in this work.</p>

<p>To a person acquainted with modern Arabian manners, it must appear inconsistent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>with truth to describe such females as exposing their faces before strange men, unless
he can discover in sober histories some evidence of their having been less strict in this
respect than the generality of Arab females at the present period. I find, however, a
remarkable proof that such was the case in the latter part of the ninth century of the
Flight, and the beginning of the tenth: that is, about the end of the fifteenth century
of our era. The famous historian Es-Suyoo&#7789;ee, who flourished at this period, in his
preface to a curious work on wedlock, written to correct the corrupt manners of his
age, says,&mdash;"Seeing that the women of this time deck themselves with the attire of
prostitutes, and walk in the soo&#7731;s (or market-streets), like female warriours against the
religion, and uncover their faces and hands before men, to incline [men's] hearts to them
by evil suggestions, and play at feasts with young men, thereby meriting the anger of
the Compassionate [i.e. God], and go forth to the public baths and assemblies, with
various kinds of ornaments and perfumes, and with conceited gait; for the which they
shall be congregated in Hell-fire, for opposing the good, and on account of this their
affected gait, while to their husbands they are disobedient, behaving to them in the
reverse manner, excepting when they fear to abridge their liberty of going abroad by
such conduct; for they are like swine and apes in their interior nature, though like
daughters of Adam in their exterior appearance; especially the women of this age;
not advising their husbands in matters of religion, but the latter erring in permitting
them to go out to every assembly; sisters of devils and demons, &amp;c. &amp;c.... I have
undertaken the composition of this volume."<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> A more convincing testimony than
this, I think, cannot be required.</p>

<p>The lute (el-'ood) is the only instrument that is generally described as used at the
entertainments which we have been considering. Engravings of this and other musical
instruments are given in my work on the Modern Egyptians. The Arab viol (called
rab&aacute;b) was commonly used by inferior performers. (See also Note 26, below.)</p>

<p>The Arab music is generally of a soft and plaintive character, and particularly that
of the most refined description, which is distinguished by a remarkable peculiarity,
the division of tones into thirds. The singer aims at distinct enunciation of the
words, for this is justly admired; and delights in a trilling style. The airs of songs
are commonly very short and simple, adapted to a single verse, or even to a single
hemistich; but in the instrumental music there is more variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III23" id="III23">23.</a></span> This is often said to a person whose presence is disagreeable to his companions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III24" id="III24">24.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the</i> &#7730;alenderees. In the old translation, these three strangers are
called "Calenders;" that is, "&#7730;alenderees:" but in the Calcutta edition of the first
two hundred nights, and the edition of Breslau, they are designated as "&#7730;arendelees,"
"miserable or ridiculous beggars;" and in that of Cairo, the term applied to them is
"&#7779;a'&aacute;leek," or, simply, "paupers," or "mendicants." Some may suppose the right
reading to be "&#7730;alenderees;" for it was a custom of this order of Darweeshes to shave
their beards: they were forbidden to do so in the year of the Flight 761,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> by the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of Egypt (El-Melik en-N&aacute;&#7779;ir El-&#7716;asan); but whether they afterwards reverted
to this habit, I do not know. The order of the &#7730;alenderees, however, was not founded
until about the commencement of the fifth century of the Flight,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> a period long
posterior to that to which the tale relates.</p>

the Persian "chang." It has almost fallen into disuse, and I have never seen it: I am
enabled, however, to give two sketches of its form through the kindness of the [late]
Right Honourable Sir Gore Ouseley, who has favoured me with drawings made from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>two of the most satisfactory representations of it in his rich collection of Oriental MSS.;
the first, about 350 years old; the second 410. The number of strings, he informs me,
vary from 20 to 27.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III27" id="III27">27.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Title and Office of</i> Khaleefeh. As most of our best authors on
Oriental subjects have for some years past deviated from our old general mode of
writing this title, substituting (for "Caliph") "Khalif," "Khal&iacute;fah," &amp;c., I have taken
the same liberty. It cannot be correctly written, at the same time congenially with
our language and with its orthography in Arabic characters, otherwise than "Khaleefeh"
or "Khaleefah;" and of these two modes I adopt the one which agrees with the manner
in which the title is most generally pronounced by the Arabs. The meaning of this
title is "Successor," or "Vicar;" and it was originally given to the universal sovereigns
of the Muslim Arabs, as signifying "Successor of the Prophet;" but afterwards,
in a more exalted sense, as "Vicar of God:" the Khaleefeh being the head of the
religion as well as the supreme political governor, or at least arrogating to himself the
right to possess such supremacy, throughout the whole Muslim world. [The last of
the Khaleefehs died in Egypt shortly after the Turkish conquest of that country, or
in the year of the Flight, 950. After the overthrow of the house of El-'Abb&aacute;s by
Hul&aacute;g&ugrave;, certain of its members obtained an asylum at the court of the Memlook
Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns, and continued the line of the Khaleefehs, with spiritual, but no temporal,
authority until it ceased in the person of El-Mutawekkil, who delegated his office to
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Seleem I.; it is consequently held by the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of Turkey. The Emperors
of Morocco, being descendants of the Prophet, also claim and receive from their subjects
the title of Khaleefeh.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

designed for the accommodation of merchants, and for the reception of their goods.
In Egypt, a building of this kind is generally called a Wek&aacute;leh. I have described it,
in a former work, as surrounding a square or oblong court, and having, on the ground-floor,
vaulted magazines for merchandise, which face the court, and are sometimes used
as shops. Above these are generally lodgings, which are entered from a gallery
extending along each of the four sides of the court; or, in the place of these lodgings,
there are other magazines: and in many kh&aacute;ns or wek&aacute;lehs which have apartments
designed as lodgings, these apartments are used as magazines. In general, the building
has only one common entrance; the door of which is closed at night, and kept by a
porter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III32" id="III32">32.</a></span> It is customary for a guest or visiter to ask permission of the host, or
master of the house, before taking his departure. A common form of speech used on
this occasion is, "With your permission, I rise."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III33" id="III33">33.</a></span> Many Muslims perform the pilgrimage with the view of expiating their
offences, and, at the Ka&#7841;beh, or at the tomb of the Prophet, make a vow to abstain from
any glaring infringement of the law of which they may before have been guilty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III34" id="III34">34.</a></span> I learn, from a marginal note in my copy of the original, by the sheykh
Mo&#7717;ammad E&#7789;-Tan&#7789;&aacute;wee, that these verses are the composition of Ibn-Sahl El-Ishbee-lee.
Three concluding verses of the same ode, and a second poetical quotation immediately
following, I have passed over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III35" id="III35">35.</a></span> In the original there are some errors in this part of the story, which
the sequel requires me to correct. The cateress is described as having sung three
successive songs, accompanying them with her lute. After the first song, the mistress
of the house is said to have been affected in the manner described in the translation,
and to have exposed to view the marks of beating. The second lady (namely, the
portress) is represented as similarly excited by the second song; and the third lady
(the cateress herself), by the third song. The last also is said to have exhibited upon
her person those marks which, as the sequel shews, were borne by the second.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III36" id="III36">36.</a></span> The "mi&#7731;ra'ah," vulgarly called "ma&#7731;ra'ah," is a portion of the thicker
end of a palm-branch stripped of the leaves. It is often used to beat a person in sport;
but in this case, two or three splits are usually made in the thicker part of it, to increase
the sound of the blows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III37" id="III37">37.</a></span> In the original, "the portress." See Note 35, above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III38" id="III38">38.</a></span> Perhaps it is needless to explain that the wish here expressed, for a
protractive trial on the day of judgment, is occasioned by the longing for reunion, and
the fear of separation after that day. The Muslims usually pray for an easy (and,
consequently, a short) reckoning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III39" id="III39">39.</a></span> I have omitted the third song of the cateress, and the description of its
effects, mentioned in Note 35.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III41" id="III41">41.</a></span> It seems to be implied that the lady discovered her guests, notwithstanding
their disguise, to be persons of rank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III42" id="III42">42.</a></span> I read "fu&#7731;ar&aacute;&uuml; a&#7841;j&aacute;m" for "fu&#7731;ar&aacute;&uuml;-l-hojj&aacute;m:" the former, carelessly
written (in Arabic characters), might easily be mistaken for the latter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III43" id="III43">43.</a></span> This phrase is used to signify "Recover thy senses;" alluding to a
person's drawing his hand over his head or face after a sleep or fit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III44" id="III44">44.</a></span> The burial-grounds of Eastern cities are generally so extensive, that,
with the varied structures which they contain, they may aptly be called "Cities of the
Dead." It was with difficulty that I recognised the tomb of the lamented Burckhardt,
in the great cemetery on the north of Cairo, even after I had carefully noticed its place
on a former visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III45" id="III45">45.</a></span> I have ventured to make a slight alteration here; but it is one which
does not in the least affect the consistency of the tale. Marriage with a foster-sister is

to shave it off, at least after it has been suffered to grow for many days, they consider as

of those persons who seek, or enjoy, the reputation of sanctity, and who are, or pretend
to be, insane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

some art or occupation by which he may, in case of necessity, at least be able to obtain
the means of supporting himself and such of his family as are dependant upon him,
and of fulfilling all his religious as well as moral duties. Hence it has been a common
custom of Muslim princes, in every age, to learn some useful art; and many of them
have distinguished themselves by displaying exquisite skill in the work of their hands,
and especially in caligraphy, of which the Orientals in general are great admirers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III54" id="III54">54.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Sherbets.</i> The Arabs have various kinds of sherbets, or sweet drinks;
the most common of which is merely sugar and water, made very sweet. The most
esteemed kind is prepared from a hard conserve of violets, made by pounding violet-flowers,
and then boiling them with sugar. Other kinds are prepared from conserves
of fruits, &amp;c. The sherbet is served in covered glass cups, containing from two-thirds
to three-quarters of an English pint; the same which I have described in a former
note as used for wine. These are placed on a round tray, and covered with a round
piece of embroidered silk, or cloth of gold; and on the right arm of the person who
presents the sherbet, is hung a long napkin with a deep embroidered border of gold
and coloured silks at each end, which is ostensibly offered for the purpose of wiping the
lips after drinking, though the lips are scarcely touched with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III55" id="III55">55.</a></span> The Arabs are very fond of having their feet, and especially the soles,
slowly rubbed with the hand; and this operation, which is one of the services commonly
required of a wife or female slave, is a usual mode of waking a person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III56" id="III56">56.</a></span> Here, and again in the same and a subsequent sentence, for "kheiy&aacute;&#7789;een,"
I read "&#7717;a&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;been." In the Breslau edition, "kha&#7789;&#7789;&aacute;been" is put for the latter. The
right reading is obvious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III58" id="III58">58.</a></span> Four verses here inserted in the original appear to me to be a corruption

several other stories in this work, require that the reader should be acquainted with
the remarkable opinions which the Arabs entertain with respect to the offices and
supernatural powers of their saints. Such matters form an important part of the
mysteries of the Darweeshes, and are but imperfectly known to the generality of
Muslims.</p>

<p>The distinguished individuals above mentioned are known by the common appellation
of "Welees," or particular favourites of God. The more eminent among them
compose a mysterious hierarchical body, whose government respects the whole human
race, infidels as well as believers; but whose power is often exercised in such a manner
that the subjects influenced by it know not from what person or persons its effects proceed.
The general governor or coryph&aelig;us of these holy beings is commonly called the
"&#7730;u&#7789;b," which literally signifies a "pole," or an "axis," and is metaphorically used to
signify a "chief," either in a civil or political, or in a spiritual sense. The &#7730;u&#7789;b of the
saints is distinguished by other appellations: he is called "&#7730;u&#7789;b el-Gh&oacute;s," or "&mdash;&mdash; el-Gh&oacute;th"
("the &#7730;u&#7789;b of Invocation for Help"), &amp;c.; and simply "El-Gh&oacute;s."<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> The
orders under the rule of this chief are called "'Omud (or Owt&aacute;d), Akhy&aacute;r, Abd&aacute;l,
Nujab&agrave;, and Nu&#7731;ab&agrave;: I name them according to their precedence.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> Perhaps to these
should be added an inferior order called "A&#7779;-&#7717;&aacute;b ed-Darak," which is said to mean
"Watchmen," or "Overseers." The members are not known as such to their inferior,
unenlightened fellow-creatures; and are often invisible to them. This is more frequently
the case with the &#7730;u&#7789;b, who, though generally stationed at Mekkeh, on the
roof of the Ka&#7841;beh, is never visible there, nor at any of his other favourite stations or
places of resort; yet his voice is often heard at these places. Whenever he and the
saints under his authority mingle among ordinary men, they are not distinguished by a
dignified appearance, but are always humbly clad. These, and even inferior saints, are
said to perform astonishing miracles, such as flying in the air, passing unhurt through
fire, swallowing fire, glass, &amp;c., walking upon water, transporting themselves in a
moment of time to immense distances, and supplying themselves and others with food
in desert places. Their supernatural power they are supposed to obtain by a life of the
most exalted piety, and especially by constant self-denial, accompanied with the most
implicit reliance upon God; by the services of good genii; and, as many believe, by the
knowledge and utterance of "the most great name" of God. A miracle performed by
a saint is distinguished by the term "kar&aacute;meh" from one performed by a prophet, which
is called "mo&#7841;jizeh."</p>

<p>El-Khi&#7693;r and Ily&aacute;s (or Elias), of whom I have before had occasion to speak, are
both believed to have been &#7730;u&#7789;bs, and the latter is called in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n an apostle; but
it is disputed whether the former was a prophet or merely a welee. Both are said to
have drunk of the Fountain of Life, and to be in consequence still living; and Ily&aacute;s is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>commonly believed to invest the successive &#7730;u&#7789;bs. The similarity of the miracles
ascribed to the &#7730;u&#7789;bs and those performed by Elias or Elijah I have remarked in
a former work. Another miracle, reminding us of the mantle of Elijah in the hands of
his successor, may here be mentioned.&mdash;A saint who was the &#7730;u&#7789;b of his time, dying at
Toonis (or Tunis), left his clothes in trust to his attendant, Mo&#7717;ammad El-Ashwam, a
native of the neighbouring regency of Tripoli (now called &#7788;ar&aacute;bulus), who desired to
sell these relics, but was counselled to retain them, and accordingly, though high
prices were bidden for them, made them his own by purchase. As soon as they
became his property, he was affected, we are told, with a divine ecstasy, and endowed
with miraculous powers.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>Innumerable miracles are related to have been performed by Muslim saints, and
large volumes are filled with the histories of their wonderful lives. The author of the
work from which the above story is taken, mentions, as a fact to be relied on, in an
account of one of his ancestors, that, his lamp happening to go out one night while he
was reading alone in the riw&aacute;&#7731; of the Jabart (of which he was the sheykh), in the great
mosque El-Azhar, the forefinger of his right hand emitted a light which enabled him
to continue his reading until his na&#7731;eeb had trimmed and lighted another lamp.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p>From many stories of a similar kind that I have read, I select the following as a
fair specimen: it is related by a very celebrated saint, Ibr&aacute;heem El-Khoww&aacute;&#7779;.&mdash;"I
entered the desert [on pilgrimage to Mekkeh from El-'Er&aacute;&#7731;], and there joined me a
man having a belt round his waist, and I said, 'Who art thou?'&mdash;He answered, 'A
Christian; and I desire thy company.' We walked together for seven days, eating
nothing; after which he said to me, 'O monk of the Muslims, produce what thou hast
in the way of refreshment; for we are hungry:' so I said, 'O my God, disgrace me not
before this infidel:' and lo, a tray, upon which were bread and broiled meat and fresh
dates and a mug of water. We ate, and continued our journey seven days more; and
I then said to him, 'O monk of the Christians, produce what thou hast in the way of
refreshment; for the turn is come to thee:' whereupon he leaned upon his staff; and
prayed; and lo, two trays, containing double that which was on my tray. I was confounded,
and refused to eat: he urged me, saying, 'Eat;' but I did it not. Then said
he, 'Be glad; for I give thee two pieces of good news: one of them is, that I testify
that there is no deity but God, and that Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle: the other, that
I said, O God, if there be worth in this servant, supply me with two trays:&mdash;so this is
through thy blessing.' We ate, and the man put on the dress of pilgrimage, and so
entered Mekkeh, where he remained with me a year as a student; after which he died,
and I buried him in [the cemetery] El-Ma&#7841;l&agrave;." "And God," says the author from
whom I take this story, "is all-knowing:" <i>i.e.</i> He alone knoweth whether it be strictly
true: but this is often added to the narration of traditions resting upon high authority.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>&mdash;The
saint above mentioned was called "El-Khoww&aacute;&#7779;" (or the maker of palm-leaf
baskets, &amp;c.) from the following circumstance, related by himself.&mdash;"I used," said he,
"to go out of the town [Er-Rei] and sit by a river on the banks of which was abundance
of palm-leaves; and it occurred to my mind to make every day five baskets [&#7731;uffehs],
and to throw them into the river, for my amusement, as if I were obliged to do so.
My time was so passed for many days: at length, one day, I thought I would walk
after the baskets, and see whither they had gone: so I proceeded a while along the
bank of the river, and found an old woman sitting sorrowful. On that day I had made
nothing. I said to her, 'Wherefore do I see thee sorrowful?' She answered, 'I am a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>widow: my husband died leaving five daughters, and nothing to maintain them; and
it is my custom to repair every day to this river, and there come to me, upon the
surface of the water, five baskets, which I sell, and by means of them I procure food;
but to-day they have not come, and I know not what to do.' Upon hearing this, I
raised my head towards heaven, and said, 'O my God, had I known that I had more
than five children to maintain, I had laboured more diligently!'" He then took the
old woman to his house, and gave her money and flour, and said to her, "Whenever
thou wantest anything, come hither and take what may suffice you."<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>An irresistible influence has often been exercised over the minds of princes and
other great men by reputed saints. Many a Muslim Monarch has thus been incited (as
the Kings of Christendom were by Peter the Hermit) to undertake religious wars, or
urged to acts of piety and charity; or restrained from tyranny by threats of Divine
vengeance to be called down upon his head by the imprecations of a welee. 'Alee, the
favourite son of the Khaleefeh El-Ma-moon, was induced, for the sake of religion, to
flee from the splendour and luxuries of his father's court, and, after the example of a
self-denying devotee, to follow the occupation of a porter, in a state of the most abject
poverty, at El-Ba&#7779;rah, fasting all the day, remaining without sleep at night in a
mosque, and walking barefooted, until, under an accumulation of severe sufferings, he
prematurely ended his days, dying on a mat. The honours which he refused to receive
in life were paid to him after his death: his rank being discovered by a ring and paper
which he left, his corpse was anointed with camphor and musk and aloes, wrapped in
fine linen of Egypt, and so conveyed to his distressed father at Baghd&aacute;d.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p>Self-denial I have before mentioned as one of the most important means by which
to attain the dignity of a welee. A very famous saint, Esh-Shiblee, is said to have
received from his father an inheritance of sixty millions of deen&aacute;rs (a sum incredible, and
probably a mistake for sixty thousand, or for sixty million dirhems), besides landed
property, and to have expended it all in charity: also, to have thrown into the Tigris
seventy hundred-weight of books, written by his own hand during a period of twenty
years.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>Sh&aacute;h El-Karm&aacute;nee, another celebrated saint, had a beautiful daughter, whom the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of his country sought in marriage. The holy man required three days to consider
his sovereign's proposal, and in the mean time visited several mosques, in one of which
he saw a young man humbly occupied in prayer. Having waited till he had finished,
he accosted him, saying, "My son, hast thou a wife?" Being answered, "No," he said,
"I have a maiden, a virtuous devotee, who hath learned the whole of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and
is amply endowed with beauty. Dost thou desire her?"&mdash;"Who," said the young
man, "will marry me to such a one as thou hast described, when I possess no more
than three dirhems?"&mdash;"<i>I</i> will marry thee to her," answered the saint: "she is my
daughter, and I am Sh&aacute;h the son of Shuj&aacute;&#7841; El-Karm&aacute;nee: give me the dirhems that
thou hast, that I may buy a dirhem's worth of bread, and a dirhem's worth of something
savoury, and a dirhem's worth of perfume." The marriage-contract was performed;
but when the bride came to the young man, she saw a stale cake of bread
placed upon the top of his mug; upon which she put on her iz&aacute;r, and went out. Her
husband said, "Now I perceive that the daughter of Sh&aacute;h El-Karm&aacute;nee is displeased
with my poverty." She answered, "I did not withdraw from fear of poverty, but on
account of the weakness of thy faith, seeing how thou layest by a cake of bread for the
morrow."<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>One of my friends in Cairo, Abu-l-&#7730;&aacute;sim of Geel&aacute;n, mentioned in a former note,
entertained me with a long relation of the mortifications and other means which he
employed to attain the rank of a welee. These were chiefly self-denial and a perfect
reliance upon Providence. He left his home in a state of voluntary destitution and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>complete nudity, to travel through Persia and the surrounding countries, and yet more
distant regions if necessary, in search of a spiritual guide. For many days he avoided
the habitations of men, fasting from daybreak till sunset, and then eating nothing but
a little grass or a few leaves or wild fruits, till by degrees he habituated himself to
almost total abstinence from every kind of nourishment. His feet, at first blistered,
and cut by sharp stones, soon became callous; and in proportion to his reduction of
food, his frame, contrary to the common course of nature, became (according to his own
account) more stout and lusty. Bronzed by the sun, and with his black hair hanging
over his shoulders (for he had abjured the use of the razor), he presented, in his nudity,
a wild and frightful appearance; and on his first approaching a town, was surrounded
and pelted by a crowd of boys; he therefore retreated, and, after the example of our
first parents, made himself a partial covering of leaves; and this he always after did on
similar occasions; never remaining long enough in a town for his leafy apron to wither.
The abodes of mankind he always passed at a distance, excepting when several days'
fast, while traversing an arid desert, compelled him to obtain a morsel of bread or a
cup of water from the hand of some charitable fellow-creature. One thing that he particularly
dreaded was, to receive relief from a sinful man, or from a demon in the
human form. In passing over a parched and desolate tract, where for three days he
had found nothing to eat, not even a blade of grass, nor a spring from which to refresh
his tongue, he became overpowered with thirst, and prayed that God would send him a
messenger with a pitcher of water. "But," said he, "let the water be in a green
Baghd&aacute;hee pitcher, that I may know it be from Thee, and not from the Devil; and
when I ask the bearer to give me to drink, let him pour it over my head, that I may
not too much gratify my carnal desire."&mdash;"I looked behind me," he continued, "and
saw a man bearing a green Baghd&aacute;hee pitcher of water, and said to him, 'Give me to
drink;' and he came up to me, and poured the contents over my head, and departed!
By Allah it was so!"&mdash;Rejoicing in this miracle, as a proof of his having attained to a
degree of wil&aacute;yeh (or saintship), and refreshed by the water, he continued his way over
the desert, more firm than ever in his course of self-denial, which, though imperfectly
followed, had been the means of his being thus distinguished. But the burning thirst
returned shortly after, and he felt himself at the point of sinking under it, when he
beheld before him a high hill, with a rivulet running by its base. To the summit of
this hill he determined to ascend, by way of mortification, before he would taste the
water, and this point, with much difficulty, he reached at the close of the day. Here
standing, he saw approaching, below, a troop of horsemen, who paused at the foot of the
hill, when their chief, who was foremost, called out to him by name, "O Abu-l-&#7730;&aacute;sim!
O Geel&aacute;nee! Come down and drink!"&mdash;but, persuaded by this that he was Iblees with
a troop of his sons, the evil Genii, he withstood the temptation, and remained stationary
until the deceiver with his attendants had passed on, and were out of sight. The sun
had then set; his thirst had somewhat abated; and he only drank a few drops. Continuing
his wanderings in the desert, he found, upon a pebbly plain, an old man with a
long white beard, who accosted him, asking of what he was in search. "I am seeking,"
he answered, "a spiritual guide; and my heart tells me that thou art the guide I seek."
"My son," said the old man, "thou seest yonder a saint's tomb: it is a place where
prayer is answered: go thither, enter it, and seat thyself: neither eat nor drink nor
sleep; but occupy thyself solely, day and night, in repeating silently, 'L&aacute; il&aacute;ha illa-ll&aacute;h'
(There is no deity but God); and let not any living creature see thy lips move in
doing so; for among the peculiar virtues of these words is this, that they may be
uttered without any motion of the lips. Go, and peace be on thee."&mdash;"Accordingly,"
said my friend, "I went thither. It was a small square building, crowned by a cupola;
and the door was open. I entered, and seated myself, facing the niche, and the oblong
monument over the grave. It was evening, and I commenced my silent professions of
the Unity, as directed by my guide; and at dusk I saw a white figure seated beside me,
as if assisting in my devotional task. I stretched forth my hand to touch it; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
found that it was not a material substance; yet there it was: I saw it distinctly.
Encouraged by this vision, I continued my task for three nights and days without
intermission, neither eating not drinking, yet increasing in strength both of body and
of spirit; and on the third day, I saw written upon the whitewashed walls of the tomb,
and on the ground, and in the air, wherever I turned my eyes, 'L&aacute; il&aacute;ha illa-ll&aacute;h;' and
whenever a fly entered the tomb, it formed these words in its flight. By Allah it was
so! My object was now fully attained: I felt myself endowed with supernatural
knowledge: thoughts of my friends and acquaintances troubled me not; but I knew
where each of them was, in Persia, India, Arabia, and Turkey, and what each was
doing. I experienced an indescribable happiness. This state lasted several years; but
at length I was insensibly enticed back to worldly objects: I came to this country; my
fame as a caligraphist drew me into the service of the government; and now see what
I am, decked with pelisses and shawls, and with this thing [a diamond order] on my
breast; too old, I fear, to undergo again the self-denial necessary to restore me to true
happiness, though I have almost resolved to make the attempt."&mdash;Soon after this conversation,
he was deprived of his office, and died of the plague. He was well known to
have passed several years as a wandering devotee; and his sufferings, combined with
enthusiasm, perhaps disordered his imagination, and made him believe that he really
saw the strange sights which he described to me; for there was an appearance of
earnestness and sincerity in his manner, such as I thought could hardly be assumed by
a conscious impostor.</p>

<p>Insanity, however, if not of a very violent and dangerous nature, is commonly
regarded by Muslims as a quality that entitles the subject of it to be esteemed as a
saint; being supposed to be the abstraction of the mind from worldly affairs, and its
total devotion to God. This popular superstition is a fertile source of imposture; for,
a reputation for sanctity being so easily obtained and supported, there are numbers of
persons who lay claim to it from motives of indolence and licentiousness, eager to
receive alms merely for performing the tricks of madmen, and greedy of indulging in
pleasures forbidden by the law; such indulgences not being considered in their case as
transgressions by the common people, but rather as indications of holy frenzy. From
my own observation I should say that lunatics or idiots, or impostors, constitute the
majority of the persons reputed to be saints among the Muslims of the present day;
and most of those who are not more than slightly tinged with insanity are darweeshes.</p>

<p>A reputed saint of this description, in Cairo, in whom persons of some education put
great faith, affected to have a particular regard for me. He several times accosted me
in an abrupt manner, acquainted me with the state of my family in England, and
uttered incoherent predictions respecting me, all of which communications, excepting
one which he qualified with an "in sh&aacute;a-ll&aacute;h" (or "if it be the will of God"), I must
confess, proved to be true; but I must also state that he was acquainted with two of
my friends who might have materially assisted him to frame these predictions, though
they protested to me that they had not done so. The following extract from a journal
which I kept in Cairo during my second visit to Egypt, will convey some idea of this
person, who will serve as a picture of many of his fraternity.&mdash;To-day (Nov. 6th, 1834),
as I was sitting in the shop of the B&aacute;sh&agrave;'s booksellers, a reputed saint, whom I have
often seen here, came and seated himself by me, and began, in a series of abrupt sentences,
to relate to me various matters respecting me, past, present, and to come. He is called
the sheykh 'Alee El-Leysee. He is a poor man, supported by alms; tall and thin and
very dark, about thirty years of age, and wears nothing at present but a blue shirt and
a girdle, and a padded red cap. "O Efendee," he said, "thou hast been very anxious
for some days. There is a grain of anxiety remaining in thee yet. Do not fear. There
is a letter coming to thee by sea, that will bring thee good news." He then proceeded
to tell me of the state of my family, and that all were well excepting one, whom he particularized
by description, and who he stated to be then suffering from an intermittent
fever. [This proved to be exactly true.] "This affliction," he continued, "may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
removed by prayer; and the excellences of the next night, the night of [<i>i. e.</i> preceding]
the first Friday of the month of Regeb, of Regeb, the holy Regeb, are very great. I
wanted to ask thee for something to-day; but I feared: I feared greatly. Thou must
be invested with the wil&aacute;yeh [<i>i. e.</i> be made a welee]: the welees love thee; and the
Prophet loves thee. Thou must go to the sheykh Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&agrave; El-Mun&aacute;dee, and the
sheykh El-Bah&aacute;ee.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> Thou must be a welee." He then took my right hand, in the
manner commonly practised in the ceremony which admits a person a darweesh, and
repeated the F&aacute;te&#7717;ah (commonly pronounced F&aacute;t'&#7717;ah);<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> after which he added, "I have
admitted thee my darweesh." Having next told me of several circumstances relating
to my family&mdash;matters of an unusual nature&mdash;with singular minuteness and truth, he
added, "To-night, if it be the will of God, thou shalt see the Prophet in thy sleep, and
El-Khi&#7693;r and the seyyid El-Bedawee. This is Regeb, and I wanted to ask of thee&mdash;but
I feared&mdash;I wanted to ask of thee four piastres, to buy meat and bread and oil
and radishes. Regeb! Regeb! I have great offices to do for thee to-night."&mdash;Less than
a shilling for all he promised was little enough: I gave it him for the trouble he had
taken; and he uttered many abrupt prayers for me.&mdash;In the following night, however,
I saw in my sleep neither Mo&#7717;ammad nor El-Khi&#7693;r nor the seyyid El-Bedawee, unless,
like Nebuchadnezzar, I was unable, on awaking, to remember my dreams.</p>

<p>Some reputed saints of the more respectable class, to avoid public notice, wear the
general dress and manners of their fellow-countrymen, and betray no love of ostentation
in their acts of piety and self-denial; or live as hermits in desert places, depending
solely upon Providence for their support, and are objects of pious and charitable visits
from the inhabitants of near and distant places, and from casual travellers. Others
distinguish themselves by the habit of a darweesh, or by other peculiarities, such as a
long and loose coat (called dil&#7731;) composed of patches of cloth of various colours, long
strings of beads hung upon the neck, a ragged turban, and a staff with shreds of cloth
of different colours attached to the top; or obtain a reputation for miraculous powers
by eating glass, fire, serpents, &amp;c. Some of those who are insane, and of those who
feign to be so, go about, even in crowded cities, in a state of perfect nudity, and are
allowed to commit, with impunity, acts of brutal sensuality which the law, when
appealed to, should punish with death. Such practices are forbidden by the religion
and law even in the cases of saints; but common and deeply-rooted superstition prevents
their punishment. During the occupation of Egypt by the French, the Commander-in-chief,
Menou, applied to the Sheykhs (or 'Ulam&agrave;) of the city for their opinion
"respecting those persons who were accustomed to go about in the streets in a state of
nudity, crying out and screaming, and arrogating to themselves the dignity of wil&aacute;yeh,
relied upon as saints by the generality of the people, neither performing the prayers of
the Muslims nor fasting," asking whether such conduct was permitted by the religion,
or contrary to the law. He was answered, "Conduct of this description is forbidden,
and repugnant to our religion and law and to our traditions." The French General
thanked them for this answer, and gave orders to prevent such practices in future, and
to seize every one seen thus offending; if insane, to confine him in the M&aacute;rist&aacute;n (or
hospital and lunatic asylum); and if not insane, to compel him either to relinquish his
disgusting habits, or to leave the city.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a>&mdash;Of reputed saints of this kind, thus writes an

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>
<p>These lines are quoted by El-Jabartee, in his account of a very celebrated modern
saint, the seyyid 'Alee El-Bekree (events of Rabee&#7841; eth-Th&aacute;nee, 1214). A brief history
of this person will not be here misplaced, as it will present a good illustration of the
general character and actions of those insane individuals who are commonly regarded
as saints.</p>

<p>The seyyid 'Alee El-Bekree was a mejzoob (or insane person) who was considered an
eminent welee, and much trusted in: for several years he used to walk naked about the
streets of Cairo, with a shaven face, bearing a long nebboot (or staff), and uttering
confused language, which the people attentively listened to, and interpreted according
to their desires and the exigencies of their states. He was a tall, spare man, and sometimes
wore a shirt and a cotton skull-cap; but he was generally barefooted and naked.
The respect with which he was treated induced a woman, who was called the sheykhah
Ammooneh, to imitate his example further than decency allowed: she followed him
whithersoever he went, covered at first with her iz&aacute;r (or large cotton veil thrown over
the head and body), and muttering, like him, confused language. Entering private
houses with him, she used to ascend to the &#7717;areems, and gained the faith of the women,
who presented her with money and clothes, and spread abroad that the sheykh ('Alee)
had looked upon her, and affected her with religious frenzy, so that she had become a
weleeyeh, or female saint. Afterwards, becoming more insane and intoxicated, she
uncovered her face, and put on the clothing of a man; and thus attired she still
accompanied the sheykh, and the two wandered about, followed by numbers of children
and common vagabonds; some of whom also stripped off their clothes in imitation of
the sheykh, and followed, dancing; their mad actions being attributed (like those of
the woman) to religious frenzy, induced by his look or touch, which converted them
into saints. The vulgar and young, who daily followed them, consequently increased
in numbers; and some of them, in passing through the market-streets, snatched away
goods from the shops, thus exciting great commotion wherever they went. When the
sheykh sat down in any place, the crowd stopped, and the people pressed to see him
and his mad companions. On these occasions the woman used to mount upon the
ma&#7779;&#7789;abah of a shop, or ascend a hillock, and utter disgusting language, sometimes in
Arabic, and sometimes in Turkish, while many persons among her audience would kiss
her hands to derive a blessing. After having persevered for some time in this course,
none preventing them, the party entered one day the lane leading from the principal
street of the city to the house of the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee, and were seized by a Turkish officer there
residing, named Ja&#7841;far K&aacute;shif, who, having brought them into his house, gave the
sheykh some food, and drove out the spectators, retaining the woman and the mejzoobs,
whom he placed in confinement: he then liberated the sheykh 'Alee, brought out the
woman and the mejzoobs and beat them, sent the woman to the M&aacute;rist&aacute;n, and there
confined her, and set at large the rest, after they had prayed for mercy, and clothed
themselves, and recovered from their intoxication. The woman remained a while confined
in the M&aacute;rist&aacute;n, and, when liberated, lived alone as a sheykhah, believed in by
men and women, and honoured as a saint with visits and festivals.</p>

<p>The seyyid 'Alee, after he had thus been deprived of his companions and imitators,
was constrained to lead a different kind of life. He had a cunning brother, who, to
turn the folly of this saint to a good account, and fill his own purse (seeing how great
faith the people placed in him, as the Egyptians are prone to do in such a case), confined
him in his house, and clothed him, asserting that he had his permission to do so,
and that he had been invested with the dignity of &#7730;u&#7789;b. Thus he contrived to attract
crowds of persons, men and women, to visit him. He forbade him to shave his beard,
which consequently grew to its full size; and his body became fat and stout from
abundance of food and rest; for, while he went about naked, he was, as before mentioned,
of a lean figure. During that period he used generally to pass the night
wandering, without food, through the streets, in winter and summer. Having now
servants to wait upon him, whether sleeping or waking, he passed his time in idleness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
uttering confused and incoherent words, and sometimes laughing and sometimes scolding;
and in the course of his idle loquacity he could not but let fall some words
applicable to the affairs of some of his listening visiters, who attributed such expressions
to his supernatural knowledge of the thoughts of their hearts, and interpreted
them as warnings or prophecies. Men and women, and particularly the wives of the
grandees, flocked to him with presents and votive offerings, which enriched the coffers
of his brother; and the honours which he received ceased not with his death. His
funeral was attended by multitudes from every quarter. His brother buried him in
the mosque of Esh-Shar&aacute;&iuml;bee, in the quarter of the Ezbekeeyeh, made for him a ma&#7731;&#7779;oorah
(or railed enclosure) and an oblong monument over the grave, and frequently repaired
thither with readers of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, munshids<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> to sing odes in his honour, flag-bearers,
and other persons, who wailed and screamed, rubbed their faces against the bars of the
window before his grave, and caught the air of the place in their hands to thrust it into
their bosoms and pockets. Men and women came crowding together to visit his tomb,
bringing votive offerings and wax candles, and eatables of various kinds to distribute
for his sake to the poor.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>&mdash;The oblong monument over his grave, resembling a large
chest, was covered, when I was in Cairo, with a black stuff ornamented by a line of
words from the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, in white characters, surrounding it. A servant who accompanied
me during my rides and walks used often to stop as we passed this tomb, and
touch the wooden bars of the window above mentioned with his right hand, which he
then kissed to obtain a blessing.</p>

<p>In most cases greater honour is paid to a reputed saint after his death than he
receives in his life. A small, square, whitewashed building, crowned with a dome, is
generally erected as his tomb, surrounding an oblong monument of stone, brick, or
wood, which is immediately over the sepulchral vault. At least one such building forms
a conspicuous object close by, or within, almost every Arab village; for the different
villages, and different quarters of every town and city, have their respective patron
saints, whose tombs are frequently visited, and are the scenes of periodical festivals,
generally celebrated once in every year. The tombs of many very eminent saints are
mosques; and some of these are large and handsome edifices, the monument being
under a large and lofty dome, and surrounded by an enclosure of wooden railings, or of
elegantly-worked bronze. In these buildings also, and in some others, the monument
is covered with silk or cotton stuff ornamented with words from the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, which
form a band around it. Many buildings of the more simple kind erected in honour of
saints, and some of the larger description, are mere cenotaphs, or cover only some relic
of the person to whom they are dedicated. The tombs and cenotaphs or shrines of
saints are visited by numerous persons, and on frequent occasions; most commonly on a
particular day of the week. The object of the visiter, in general, is to perform some
meritorious act, such as taking bread, or other food, or money, for the poor, or distributing
water to the thirsty, on account of the saint, to increase his rewards in
heaven, and at the same time to draw down a blessing on himself; or to perform a
sacrifice of a sheep, goat, calf, or other animal, which he has vowed to offer, if blessed
with some specific object of desire, or to obtain general blessings; or to implore the
saint's intercession in some case of need. The flesh of the devoted animal is given to
the poor. The visiters also often take with them palm-branches, or sprigs of myrtle, or
roses or other flowers, to lay upon the monument, as they do when they visit the tombs
of their relations. The visiter walks round the monument, or its enclosure, from left to
right, or with his left side towards it (as the pilgrims do round the Ka&#7841;beh), sometimes
pausing to touch its four angles or corners with his right hand, which he then
kisses; and recites the opening chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n (the F&aacute;t'&#7717;ah) standing before
one or each of its four sides. Some visiters repeat also the chapter of Y&aacute;-Seen (the
36th), or employ a person to recite this, or even the whole of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, for hire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>
<p>The reciter afterwards declares that he transfers the merit of this work to the soul of
the deceased saint. Any private petition the visiter offers up on his own account,
imploring a favourable answer for the sake of the saint, or through his intercession;
holding his hands before his face like an open book, and then drawing them down his
face. Many a visiter, on entering the tomb, kisses the threshold, or touches it with his
right hand, which he then kisses; and, on passing by it, persons often touch the
window, and kiss the hand thus honoured.</p>

<p>The great periodical or annual festivals are observed with additional ceremonies,
and by crowds of visiters. These are called Moolids (more properly M&oacute;lids); and are
held on the anniversary of the birth of the saint, or in commemoration of that event.
Persons are then hired to recite the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n in and near the tomb, during the day; and
others, chiefly darweeshes, employ themselves during the night in performing zikrs,
which consist in repeating the name of God, or the profession of his unity, &amp;c., in
chorus, accompanying the words by certain motions of the head, hands, or whole body;
munshids, at intervals, singing religious odes or love songs during these performances,
to the accompaniment of a n&aacute;y, which is a kind of flute, or the arghool, which is a
double reed-pipe. These moolids are scenes of rejoicing and of traffic, which men and
boys and girls attend, to eat sweatmeats, and drink coffee and sherbets, or to amuse
themselves with swinging, or turning on a whirligig, or witnessing the feats of conjurers,
or the performances of dancers; and to which tradesmen repair to sell or barter their
goods. The visiters to the great moolids of the seyyid A&#7717;mad El-Bedawee, at &#7788;an&#7789;&agrave;,
in the Delta of Egypt, which are great fairs as well as religious festivals, are almost as
numerous as the pilgrims at Mekkeh. During a moolid, the inhabitants of the houses
in the neighbourhood of the tomb hang lamps before their houses, and spend a great
part of the night listening to the story-tellers at the coffee-shops, or attending the zikrs.</p>

<p>These latter performances, though so common among the Arabs, are inconsistent
with the spirit of the Mohammadan religion, and especially with respect to music,
which was not employed in religious ceremonies until after the second century of the
Flight. The Im&aacute;m Aboo-Bekr E&#7789;-&#7788;oosee, being asked whether it were lawful or not to
be present with people who assembled in a certain place, and read a portion of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n; and, after a munshid had recited some poetry, would dance, and become
excited, and play upon tambourines and pipes,&mdash;answered, that such practices were
vain, ignorant, and erroneous; not ordained by the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n or the Traditions of the
Prophet, but invented by those Israelites who worshipped the Golden Calf; that the
Prophet and his companions used to sit so quietly that a bird might alight upon the
head of any one of them and not be disturbed; that it was incumbent on the Sult&aacute;n
and his vicegerents to prevent such persons from entering the mosques and other places
for these purposes; and that no one who believed in God and the Last Day should be
present with them, or assist them in their vain performances: such, he asserted, was
the opinion of the Im&aacute;ms of the Muslims.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Some eminent doctors, however, have
contended for the lawfulness of these practices.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>Of the various orders of darweeshes, to which so many of the reputed saints belong,
it is unnecessary here to say more than that they differ chiefly in unimportant regulations
and rites, such as particular forms of prayer, and modes of zikr; that some
distinguish themselves by peculiar dresses; and that a few pursue a wandering life, and
subsist on alms.</p>

adheres to the mountain; for which reason, it is the general custom to make use of no
iron in the construction of the vessels employed in this navigation.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> I think that I

true warnings or indications of future events I have mentioned in a former note.
This belief, sanctioned by the Prophet, will be well illustrated by the following anecdote,
which was related to me in Cairo, shortly after the terrible plague of the year 1835, by
the sheykh Mo&#7717;ammad E&#7789;-&#7788;an&#7789;&aacute;wee, who had taken the trouble of investigating the
fact, and had ascertained its truth.</p>

<p>A tradesman, living in the quarter of El-&#7716;anafee, in Cairo, dreamt, during the
plague above mentioned, that eleven persons were carried out from his house to be
buried, victims of this disease. He awoke in a state of the greatest distress and
alarm, reflecting that eleven was the total number of the inhabitants of his house,
including himself, and that it would be vain in him to attempt, by adding one or more
members to his household, to elude the decree of God, and give himself a chance of
escape: so, calling together his neighbours, he informed them of his dream, and was
counselled to submit with resignation to a fate so plainly foreshewn, and to be thankful
to God for the timely notice with which he had been mercifully favoured. On the
following day, one of his children died; a day or two after, a wife; and the pestilence
continued its ravages among his family until he remained in his house alone. It was
impossible for him now to entertain the slightest doubt of the entire accomplishment
of the warning: immediately, therefore, after the last death that had taken place among
his household, he repaired to a friend at a neighbouring shop, and, calling to him several
other persons from the adjoining and opposite shops, he reminded them of his dream,
acquainted them with its almost complete fulfilment, and expressed his conviction that
he, the eleventh, should very soon die. "Perhaps," said he, "I shall die this next
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>night: I beg of you, therefore, for the sake of God, to come to my house early to-morrow
morning, and the next morning and the next if necessary, and to see if I be
dead, and, when dead, that I be properly buried; for I have no one with me to wash
and shroud me. Fail not to do me this service, which will procure you a recompense in
heaven. I have bought my grave-linen: you will find it in a corner of the room in
which I sleep. If you find the door of the house latched, and I do not answer to your
knocking, break it open."</p>

<p>Soon after sunset he laid himself in his lonely bed, though without any expectation
of closing his eyes in sleep; for his mind was absorbed in reflections upon the awful
entry into another world, and a review of his past life. As the shades of night gathered
around him, he could almost fancy that he beheld, in one faint object or another in his
gloomy chamber, the dreadful person of the Angel of Death: and at length he actually
perceived a figure gliding in at the door, and approaching his bed. Starting up in
horror, he exclaimed, "Who art thou?"&mdash;and a stern and solemn voice answered, "Be
silent! I am 'Azraeel, the Angel of Death!"&mdash;"Alas!" cried the terrified man; "I
testify that there is no deity but God, and I testify that Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle!
There is no strength nor power but in God, the High! the Great! To God we belong,
and to Him we must return!"&mdash;He then covered himself over with his quilt, as if for
protection, and lay with throbbing heart, expecting every moment to have his soul torn
from him by the inexorable messenger. But moments passed away, and minutes, and
hours; yet without his experiencing any hope of escape; for he imagined that the
Angel was waiting for him to resign himself, or had left him for a while, and was
occupied in receiving first the souls of the many hundred human beings who had
attained their predestined term in that same night and in the same city, and the souls
of the thousands who were doomed to employ him elsewhere. Daybreak arrived before
his sufferings terminated; and his neighbours, coming according to their promise,
entered his chamber, and found him still in bed; but observing that he was covered up,
and motionless as a corpse, they doubted whether he were still alive, and called to him.
He answered, with a faint voice, "I am not yet dead; but the Angel of Death came to
me in the dusk of the evening, and I expect every moment his return, to take my soul:
therefore trouble me not; but see me washed and buried."&mdash;"But why," said his
friends, "was the street-door left unlatched?"&mdash;"I latched it," he answered, "but the
Angel of Death may have opened it."&mdash;"And who," they asked, "is the man in the
court?"&mdash;He answered, "I know of no man in the court: perhaps the Angel who is
waiting for my soul has made himself visible to you, and been mistaken, in the twilight,
for a man."&mdash;"He is a thief," they said, "who has gathered together everything in the
house that he could carry away, and has been struck by the plague while doing so,
and now lies dead in the court, at the foot of the stairs, grasping in his hand a silver
candlestick."&mdash;The master of the house, after hearing this, paused for a moment, and
then, throwing off his quilt, exclaimed, "Praise be to God, the Lord of all creatures!
That is the eleventh, and I am safe! No doubt it was that rascal who came to me and
said that he was the Angel of Death. Praise be to God! Praise be to God!"</p>

<p>This man survived the plague, and took pleasure in relating the above story. The
thief had overheard his conversation with his neighbours, and, coming to his house in
the dusk, had put his shoulder to the wooden lock, and so raised the door and displaced
the latch within.&mdash;There is nothing wonderful in the dream, nor in its accomplishment;
the plague of 1835 entirely desolated many houses, and was mostly fatal to the young;
and all the inhabitants of the house in question were young excepting the master.</p>

by the image, and the opening of the forbidden closet, &amp;c., appear to be taken from the
romance of Seyf Zu-l-Yezen, of which I possess a copy, purchased during my second visit
to Egypt. This romance, which has become extremely scarce, is filled with stories of
genii and enchantments of the most extravagant kind. Some of the public story-tellers
in Cairo used, a few years since, to amuse their audiences by recitations from it. I was
not able to discover the period at which it was composed; but it is said to have been
written long before the Tales of a Thousand and One Nights. I saw once a portion of
a copy of which it appeared, from the hand-writing and the paper, to be three or four
centuries old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III86" id="III86">86.</a></span> In all the copies of the original which I have by me, El-Ba&#7779;rah is said to
have been the place to which the lady designed to voyage; but this is inconsistent with
the sequel of the story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III87" id="III87">87.</a></span> In the old version, two strange errors occur in the passage corresponding
with this: two words in the original, "n&aacute;r" and "doon," having been mistaken for a
proper name; and the word "jebb&aacute;r," which, applied to God, signifies "almighty," or
rather the "Compeller of his creatures to do whatsoever He willeth," being taken in
the sense of "giant," which it bears in many other cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III88" id="III88">88.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Martyrs.</i> The Mohammadan law distinguishes several different
descriptions of martyrs. This honourable title is given to the soldier who dies in
fighting for the faith, or on his way to do so, or who dies almost immediately after his
having been wounded when so engaged; to a person who innocently meets with his
death from the hand of another; to a victim of the plague, who does not flee from the
disease, or of dysentery; to a person who is drowned; and to one who is killed by the
falling of a wall or any building. It is said that the souls of martyrs, after quitting
their bodies, reside, until the day of resurrection, in the crops of green birds, which eat
of the fruits, and drink of the waters, of Paradise. Such we are to consider as the first
and lowest state of felicity to which the young prince in this tale was introduced as the
reward of his virtue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="III89" id="III89">89.</a></span> The share inherited, according to the law, by the wife, or by the wives
conjointly when there are more than one, is one-eighth of what remains of the property
of the deceased after the discharge of his debts and legacies, if he have left issue; and

of the palaces of Baghd&aacute;d in the times of the Khaleefehs almost exceeds belief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>In the beginning of the year of the Flight 305 (June, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 917), two ambassadors
from the Greek Emperor (Constantine IX., Porphyrogenitus) arrived in Baghd&aacute;d on a
mission to the Khaleefeh El-Mu&#7731;tedir, bringing an abundance of costly presents; and
the scenes which they witnessed are thus described; apparently, however, not without
some exaggeration. They were first received by the Wezeer, who, at the audience
which he granted to them in his garden-palace, displayed on this occasion a degree of
magnificence that had never before been manifested by any of his rank; pages, memlooks,
and soldiers, crowded the avenues and courts of his mansion, the apartments of
which were hung with tapestry of the value of thirty thousand deen&aacute;rs; and the
Wezeer himself was surrounded by generals and other officers on his right and left and
behind his seat, when the two ambassadors approached him, dazzled by the splendour
that surrounded them, to beg for an interview with the Khaleefeh. El-Mu&#7731;tedir,
having appointed a day on which he would receive them, ordered that the courts and
passages and avenues of his palace should be filled with armed men, and that all the
apartments should be furnished with the utmost magnificence. A hundred and sixty
thousand armed soldiers were arranged in ranks in the approach to the palace; next to
these were the pages of the closets, and chief eunuchs, clad in silk and with belts set
with jewels, in number seven thousand; four thousand white, and three thousand black:
there were also seven hundred chamberlains; and beautifully ornamented boats of
various kinds were seen floating upon the Tigris, hard by. The two ambassadors passed
first by the palace of the chief chamberlain, and, astonished at the splendid ornaments
and pages and arms which they there beheld, imagined that this was the palace of the
Khaleefeh; but what they had seen here was eclipsed by what they beheld in the
latter, where they were amazed by the sight of thirty-eight thousand pieces of tapestry
of gold-embroidered silk brocade, and twenty-two thousand magnificent carpets. Here
also were two menageries of beasts by nature wild, but tamed by art, and eating from
the hands of men: among them were a hundred lions; each lion with its keeper. They
then entered the Palace of the Tree, enclosing a pond from which rose the Tree: this
had eighteen branches, with leaves of various colours (being artificial), and with birds
of gold and silver (or gilt and silvered) of every variety of kind and size, perched upon
its branches, so constructed that each of them sang. Thence they passed into the
garden, in which were furniture and utensils not to be enumerated: in the passages
leading to it were suspended ten thousand gilt coats of mail. Being at length conducted
before El-Mu&#7731;tedir, they found him seated on a couch of ebony inlaid with gold
and silver, to the right of which were hung nine necklaces of jewels, and the like to the
left, the jewels of which outshone the light of day. The two ambassadors paused at
the distance of about a hundred cubits from the Khaleefeh, with the interpreter.
Having left the presence, they were conducted through the palace, and were shewn
splendidly-caparisoned elephants, a giraffe, lynxes, and other beasts. They were then
clad with robes of honour, and to each of them was brought fifty thousand dirhems,
together with dresses and other presents. It is added, that the ambassadors approached
the palace through a street called "the Street of the Men&aacute;rehs," in which were a
thousand men&aacute;rehs, or menarets. It was at the hour of noon; and as they passed, the
mu&euml;ddins from all these men&aacute;rehs chanted the call to prayer at the same time, so that
the earth almost quaked at the sound, and the ambassadors were struck with fear.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>The Orientals well understand how to give the most striking effect to the jewels
which they display on their dress, &amp;c., on occasions of state. Sir John Malcolm,
describing his reception by the late King of Persia, says, "His dress baffled all description.
The ground of his robes was white; but he was so covered with jewels of an
extraordinary size, and their splendour, from his being seated where the rays of the sun
played upon them, was so dazzling, that it was impossible to distinguish the minute
parts which combined to give such amazing brilliancy to his whole figure."<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h6>COMMENCING WITH PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH NIGHT, AND ENDING
WITH PART OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH.</h6>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE THREE APPLES, &amp;c.<a href="#IV1" class="fnanchor">1</a></h5>

<p>One night, after the adventure above described, the Khaleefeh
H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed said to Ja&#7841;far, his Wezeer, We will go down to-night
into the city, and inquire respecting the affairs of those who are
at present in authority, and him against whom any one shall complain
we will displace. Ja&#7841;far replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and when the
Khaleefeh had gone forth with him and Mesroor, and they had
passed through several of the market-streets, they proceeded along a
lane, and saw there an old man, with a net and basket upon his head,
and a staff in his hand, walking at his leisure, and reciting these
verses:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They say to me, Thou shinest among mankind, by thy knowledge, like the moonlight night:</span>
<span class="i0">But I answer, Abstain from thus addressing me, since there is no knowledge without power:</span>
<span class="i0">For if they would pawn me, and my knowledge with me, and all my papers and inkhorn too,</span>
<span class="i0">For one day's food, they would never find the pledge accepted to the day of judgment.</span>
<span class="i0">As for the poor, and his condition, and his whole life, how full of trouble!</span>
<span class="i0">In the summer he fails to earn his food, and in winter he warms himself over the fire-pot.<a href="#IV2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
<span class="i0">The dogs follow him wherever he goes, and any reviler, and he cannot repel him.</span>
<span class="i0">If he states his case, and proves himself wronged, the judge will not admit his plea.</span>
<span class="i0">Such, then, being the poor man's life, his fittest place is in the burial-ground.<a href="#IV3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Khaleefeh, when he heard his recitation, said to Ja&#7841;far,
Observe this poor man, and consider these verses; for they indicate
his necessity. Then approaching the man, he said to him, O sheykh,
what is thine occupation?&mdash;O my master, answered the old man, I
am a fisherman, and have a family to maintain, and I went forth
from my house at noon, and have remained until now, but God hath
allotted me nothing wherewith to obtain food for my household;
therefore I have hated myself, and wished for death.&mdash;Wilt thou, said
the Khaleefeh, return with us to the river, and station thyself on the
bank of the Tigris, and cast thy net for my luck? If thou wilt do so I
will purchase of thee whatever cometh up for a hundred pieces of gold.&mdash;The
fisherman rejoiced when he heard these words, and said, On my
head be your commands: I will return with you.&mdash;So he went again to
the river, and cast his net, and, having waited till it sank, drew the cords,
and dragged back the net, and there came up in it a chest, locked and
heavy. When the Khaleefeh saw it, he felt its weight, and found it to
be heavy; and he gave a hundred pieces of gold to the fisherman,
who went away, while Mesroor, assisted by Ja&#7841;far, took up the chest,
and conveyed it, in company with the Khaleefeh, to the palace, where
they lighted the candles, and placed the chest before the Khaleefeh.
Ja&#7841;far and Mesroor then broke it open, and they found in it a basket
of palm-leaves sewed up with red worsted; and they cut the threads,
and saw within it a piece of carpet, and, lifting up this, they found
beneath it an iz&aacute;r,<a href="#IV4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and when they had taken up the iz&aacute;r they discovered
under it a damsel like molten silver, killed, and cut in pieces.</p>

<p>When the Khaleefeh beheld this, tears ran down his cheeks, and,
looking towards Ja&#7841;far, he exclaimed, O dog of Wezeers, shall people
be murdered in my time, and be thrown into the river, and become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
burdens upon my responsibility? By Allah, I must retaliate for this
damsel upon him who killed her, and put him to death!&mdash;Then said
he to Ja&#7841;far, By the truth of my descent from the Khaleefehs of the
sons of El-'Abb&aacute;s, if thou do not bring to me him who killed this
woman, that I may avenge her upon him, I will crucify thee at the
gate of my palace, together with forty of thy kinsmen!<a href="#IV5" class="fnanchor">5</a> And the
Khaleefeh was enraged.&mdash;Grant me, said Ja&#7841;far, a delay of three days.&mdash;I
grant thee the delay, replied the Khaleefeh. Ja&#7841;far then went
forth from his presence, and took his route through the city, sorrowful,
and saying within himself, How shall I discover him who killed
this damsel, that I may take him before the Khaleefeh? And if I
take to him any other person, he will become a weight upon my
conscience. I know not what to do.&mdash;For three days he remained in
his house, and on the fourth day the Khaleefeh sent to summon him,
and, when he had presented himself before him, said to him, Where
is the murderer of the damsel?&mdash;O Prince of the Faithful, answered
Ja&#7841;far, am I acquainted with things hidden from the senses, that I
should know who is her murderer? The Khaleefeh, incensed at this
answer, gave orders to crucify him at the gate of his palace, and commanded
a crier to proclaim through the streets of Baghd&aacute;d, Whosoever
desireth to amuse himself by seeing the crucifixion of Ja&#7841;far
El-Barmekee, the Wezeer of the Khaleefeh, and the crucifixion of his
kinsmen, at the gate of the Khaleefeh's palace, let him come forth and
amuse himself.&mdash;So the people came forth from every quarter to see
the crucifixion of Ja&#7841;far and his kinsmen; and they knew not the
cause of this. The Khaleefeh then gave orders to set up the crosses;
and they did so, and placed the Wezeer and his kinsmen beneath, to
crucify them, and were awaiting the Khaleefeh's permission, while
the people wept for Ja&#7841;far and his relatives.</p>

<p>But while they were thus waiting, a handsome and neatly-dressed
young man came forward quickly through the crowd, and, approaching
the Wezeer, said to him, Safety to thee from this predicament, O
chief of Emeers, and refuge of the poor! It was I who killed the
woman whom ye found in the chest: kill me therefore for her, and
retaliate her death upon me.&mdash;When Ja&#7841;far heard these words, he
rejoiced for his own deliverance, and grieved for the young man: but
while he was speaking to him, lo, an old sheykh pressed hastily
through the crowd to him and the young man, and, having saluted
them, said, O Wezeer, believe not the words of this young man, for no
one killed the damsel but myself; therefore retaliate her death upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
me. The young man, however, said, O Wezeer, this is an old man,
imbecile through age; he knoweth not what he saith: it was I who
killed her; avenge her therefore upon me.&mdash;O my son, said the
sheykh, thou art young, and wilt find pleasure in the world; and I
am old, and satiated with the world: I will be a ransom for thee and
for the Wezeer and his kinsmen; and no one killed the damsel but
myself: by Allah, therefore, hasten to retaliate upon me.</p>

<p>On witnessing this scene, the Wezeer was astonished; and he
took the young man and the sheykh to the Khaleefeh, and said, O
Prince of the Faithful, the murderer of the damsel hath come.&mdash;Where
is he? said the Khaleefeh. This young man, answered Ja&#7841;far,
saith, I am the murderer;&mdash;and this sheykh accuseth him of falsehood,
and saith, Nay, but <i>I</i> am the murderer.&mdash;The Khaleefeh, looking
towards the sheykh and the young man, said, Which of you killed
this damsel? The young man answered, No one killed her but
myself:&mdash;and the sheykh said also, No one killed her but myself.
The Khaleefeh therefore said to Ja&#7841;far, Take them both and crucify
them.&mdash;If the murderer be one, replied Ja&#7841;far, to kill the other would
be unjust. The young man then said, By Him who raised the
heavens and spread out the earth, it was I who killed the damsel:&mdash;and
he gave an account of the manner of his killing her, and described
what the Khaleefeh had found. The Khaleefeh therefore was convinced
that the young man was he who had killed the damsel; and he
was astonished, and said, What was the cause of thy killing this
damsel unjustly, and of thy confessing the murder without being
beaten,<a href="#IV6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and thy saying, Retaliate her death upon me? The young
man answered as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 558px; position: relative;"><a name="f89" id="f89"></a><img src="images/fig089.png" width="558" height="647" alt="The Young Man presenting the Apples to his Wife" title="The Young Man presenting the Apples to his Wife" /></div>

<p>Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that this damsel was my wife,
and the daughter of my uncle: this sheykh was her father, and is my
uncle. I married her when she was a virgin, and God blessed me
with three male children by her; and she loved me and served me, and
I saw in her no evil. At the commencement of this month she was
attacked by a severe illness, and I brought to her the physicians, who
attended her until her health returned to her; and I desired them to
send her to the bath; but she said to me, I want something before I
enter the bath, for I have a longing for it.&mdash;What is it? said I. She
answered, I have a longing for an apple, to smell it, and take a bite
from it. So I went out immediately into the city, and searched for
the apple, and would have bought it had its price been a piece of
gold: but I could not find one. I passed the next night full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
thought, and when the morning came I quitted my house again and went
about to all the gardens, one after another; yet I found none in them.
There met me, however, an old gardener, of whom I inquired for the
apple, and he said to me, O my son, this is a rare thing, and not to
be found here, nor anywhere except in the garden of the Prince of
the Faithful at El-Ba&#7779;rah, and preserved there for the Khaleefeh. I
returned therefore to my wife, and my love for her so constrained me
that I prepared myself and journeyed fifteen days, by night and day,
in going and returning, and brought her three apples which I purchased
of the gardener at El-Ba&#7779;rah for three pieces of gold; and,
going in, I handed them to her; but she was not pleased by them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and left them by her side. She was then suffering from a violent
fever, and she continued ill during a period of ten days.</p>

<p>After this she recovered her health, and I went out and repaired
to my shop, and sat there to sell and buy;<a href="#IV7" class="fnanchor">7</a> and while I was thus
occupied, at mid-day there passed by me a black slave, having in his
hand an apple, with which he was playing: so I said to him, Whence
didst thou get this apple, for I would procure one like it?&mdash;Upon
which he laughed, and answered, I got it from my sweetheart: I had
been absent, and came, and found her ill, and she had three apples;
and she said to me, My unsuspecting husband journeyed to El-Ba&#7779;rah
for them, and bought them for three pieces of gold:&mdash;and I took this
apple from her.&mdash;When I heard the words of the slave, O Prince of
the Faithful, the world became black before my face, and I shut up
my shop, and returned to my house, deprived of my reason by
excessive rage. I found not the third apple, and said to her, Where
is the apple? She answered, I know not whither it is gone. I was
convinced thus that the slave had spoken the truth, and I arose, and
took a knife, and throwing myself upon her bosom, plunged the knife
into her: I then cut off her head and limbs, and put them in the
basket in haste, and covered them with the iz&aacute;r, over which I laid a
piece of carpet: then I put the basket in the chest, and, having locked
this, conveyed it on my mule, and threw it with my own hands into
the Tigris.<a href="#IV8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>And now, continued the young man, I conjure thee by Allah, O
Prince of the Faithful, to hasten my death in retaliation for her
murder, as I dread, otherwise, her appeal for vengeance upon me on
the day of resurrection:<a href="#IV9" class="fnanchor">9</a> for when I had thrown her into the Tigris
without the knowledge of any one, I returned to my house, and found
my eldest boy crying, though he knew not what I had done to his
mother: so I said to him, What maketh thee cry?&mdash;and he answered,
I took one of the apples that my mother had, and went down with it
into the street to play with my brothers, and a tall black slave snatched
it from me, and said to me, Whence came this to thee? I answered
him, My father made a journey for it, and brought it from El-Ba&#7779;rah,
for the sake of my mother; for she is sick: he bought three apples
for three pieces of gold:&mdash;but he took it from me and beat me,
and went away with it; and I am afraid that my mother may beat me
on account of the apple.&mdash;When I heard my son's story, I discovered
that the slave had forged a lie against the daughter of my uncle, and
found that she had been killed unjustly; and as I was weeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
bitterly for what I had done, this sheykh, my uncle and her father,
came to me, and I informed him of the event; and he seated himself
by me, and wept. We wept until midnight, and continued our
mourning for her five days, ceasing not to the present day to bewail
her death. By the honour of thine ancestors, therefore, hasten my
death, to retaliate her murder upon me.</p>

<p>The Khaleefeh wondered at the young man's story, and said, By
Allah, I will not put to death any but the wicked slave; for the
young man is excusable. Then looking towards Ja&#7841;far, he said to him,
Bring before me this wicked slave who hath been the cause of the
catastrophe; or, if thou bring him not, thou shalt be put to death in
his stead. So the Wezeer departed weeping, and saying, Whence shall
I bring him? Not every time that the jar is struck doth it escape
being broken! I have no stratagem to employ in this affair: but He
who delivered me in the first case may deliver me in the second. By
Allah, I will not go out from my house for three days; and the Truth,
whose perfection be extolled, will do what He willeth!&mdash;So he
remained in his house three days, and on the fourth day he caused the
&#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee to be brought, and made his testamentary arrangements; and
as he was bidding farewell to his children, and weeping, lo, the messenger
of the Khaleefeh came and said to him, The Prince of the
Faithful is in a most violent rage, and hath sent me to thee; and he
hath sworn that this day shall not pass until thou art put to death if
thou do not bring to him the slave.</p>

<p>On hearing this, Ja&#7841;far wept, and his children wept with him;
and when he had bidden them all farewell except his youngest
daughter, he approached her for the same purpose. He loved her
more than all his other children; and he pressed her to his bosom,
and wept at the thought of his separation from her; but, in doing
this, he felt something round in her pocket, and said to her, What is
in thy pocket? She answered, O my father, it is an apple; our slave
Rey&#7717;an<a href="#IV10" class="fnanchor">10</a> brought it, and I have had it four days; he would not give
it me until he had received from me two pieces of gold.&mdash;At this
mention of the slave and the apple, Ja&#7841;far rejoiced, and exclaimed, O
ready Dispeller of trouble!<a href="#IV11" class="fnanchor">11</a>&mdash;and immediately he ordered that the
slave should be brought before him. He was therefore brought in,
and he said to him, Whence came this apple?&mdash;O my master, he
answered, I went out five days ago, and, entering one of the by-streets
of the city, I saw some children playing, and one of them had this
apple: and I snatched it from him, and beat him; and he cried, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
said, That belongs to my mother, and she is sick: she wanted my
father to bring her an apple, and he made a journey to El-Ba&#7779;rah, and
brought back for her three apples which he bought for three pieces of
gold; and I took this to play with it:&mdash;then he cried again; but,
paying no regard to him, I took it away and brought it hither; and
my little mistress bought it of me for two pieces of gold.&mdash;When he
heard this story, Ja&#7841;far was filled with wonder at discovering that this
distressing event, and the murder of the damsel, had been occasioned
by his slave; and he took the slave and went with him to the
Khaleefeh, who ordered that the story should be committed to writing,
and published.</p>

<p>Ja&#7841;far then said to him, Wonder not, O Prince of the Faithful, at
his tale, for it is not more extraordinary than the story of the Wezeer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Noor-ed-Deen, and Shems-ed-Deen, his brother.&mdash;What story, said
the Khaleefeh, can be more wonderful than this?&mdash;O Prince of the
Faithful, replied Ja&#7841;far, I will not relate it to thee unless on the condition
that thou exempt my slave from the punishment of death. The
Khaleefeh said, I give thee his blood:&mdash;and Ja&#7841;far, thereupon, commenced
the relation of the story as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF NOOR-ED-DEEN AND HIS SON, AND OF SHEMS-ED-DEEN
AND HIS DAUGHTER.</h5>

<p>Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that there was, in Cairo,<a href="#IV12" class="fnanchor">12</a> a
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n,<a href="#IV13" class="fnanchor">13</a> just and beneficent, who had a wise and well-informed Wezeer,
possessing a knowledge of the affairs of the world, and of the art of
government. This minister was an aged man, and he had two sons,
like two moons: the name of the elder was Shems-ed-Deen, and that
of the younger, Noor-ed-Deen;<a href="#IV14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and the latter was more distinguished
than the former by handsomeness and comeliness: there was no one
in his day more handsome, so that the fame of his charms spread
through the neighbouring regions, and some of the inhabitants of
those parts travelled to his country merely to obtain a sight of him.
And it came to pass that their father died, and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n mourned
for him, and, turning his regards towards the two sons, took them
into his favour, invested them with robes of honour, and said to them,
Ye two are instated in your father's office:&mdash;at which they rejoiced, and
kissed the ground before him. They observed the ceremonies of
mourning<a href="#IV15" class="fnanchor">15</a> for their father during a period of a whole month, and
entered upon the office of Wezeers, each of them discharging the
duties of this station for a week at a time; and whenever the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n had a desire to go forth on a journey, he took one of them
with him.</p>

<p>Now it happened, one night, that the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n purposed commencing
a journey on the following morning; and it was the turn of the elder
Wezeer to accompany him; and as the two brothers were conversing
together that night, the elder said, O my brother, it is my wish that
we should both marry on one night.&mdash;Do, O my brother, as thou
desirest, answered the younger; and I will comply with that which
thou shalt say. So they agreed to do this. The elder then said to
his brother, If God so decree that we obtain the betrothal of two
maidens, and accomplish our marriage on the same night, and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
give birth to children on the same day, and God will that thy wife
have a son, and my wife have a daughter, we will marry them to each
other, for they will be cousins.&mdash;And what, O my brother, said Noor-ed-Deen,
wilt thou require of my son as the dowry of thy daughter?
He answered, I will require of thy son, as the dowry of my daughter,
three thousand pieces of gold, and three gardens, and three farms; for
if the young man make any other contract than this, it will not be
proper. But when Noor-ed-Deen heard this proposal, he exclaimed,
What is this dowry that thou imposest upon my son? Dost thou not
know that we are two brothers, and that we are both Wezeers, of one
dignity? It were incumbent on thee to offer thy daughter to my son as
a free gift, without any dowry; for thou knowest that the male is more
honourable than the female, and my child is a male, and by him shall
our memory be preserved: not by thy daughter.&mdash;What sayest thou
of her? asked his brother.&mdash;That our memory will not be preserved
by her among the nobles, answered Noor-ed-Deen. But thou desirest,
added he, to act with me according to the opinion of him who saith,
If thou desire to drive away a person who would buy, demand of him
a high price.&mdash;I see thee, replied Shems-ed-Deen, to have committed
a fault, in making thy son more honourable than my daughter: thou
art doubtless deficient in judgment, and destitute of good disposition,
seeing that thou mentionest the partnership in the office of Wezeer,
when I admitted thee not to share it with me excepting in my pity for
thee, and that thou mightest assist me: but talk as thou wilt: since
thou hast said this, by Allah, I will not marry my daughter to thy
son, though thou offer me her weight in gold.&mdash;On hearing these
words of his brother, Noor-ed-Deen was enraged, and said, I will not
marry my son to thy daughter.&mdash;I will not accept him as a husband
for her, replied Shems-ed-Deen; and if I were not purposing a journey,
I would do to thee deeds that should serve as warnings to others:
however, when I return, God will do what He willeth.&mdash;When Noor-ed-Deen
heard this, he was full of anger, and became unconscious of
existence: but he concealed his feelings; and each of the two brothers
passed the night apart from the other; and in the morning the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n
set out on his journey, and, crossing over to the island,<a href="#IV16" class="fnanchor">16</a> proceeded
towards the Pyramids, accompanied by the Wezeer Shems-ed-Deen.</p>

<p>Noor-ed-Deen passed that night in a state of the utmost rage; and
when the morning came he arose, and, having performed the morning-prayers,
went to his closet and took out from it a pair of small saddle-bags,
which he filled with gold; and as he reflected upon the words of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
his brother, and the contempt which he had shewn him, and the pride
that he had manifested towards him, he repeated these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Travel. Thou wilt find a friend in the place of him thou leavest; and fatigue thyself; for by labour are the sweets of life obtained.</span>
<span class="i0">To a man of intelligence and education there is no glory in a constant residence: therefore quit thy native place, and go abroad.</span>
<span class="i0">I have observed that the stagnation of water corrupteth it; if it floweth, it becometh sweet; but otherwise, it doth not.</span>
<span class="i0">If the full moon never set, the eye of the contemplative would not on every occasion pay regard to it:</span>
<span class="i0">The lions, if they left not the forest, would capture no prey; and the arrow, if it quitted not the bow, would not strike the mark:</span>
<span class="i0">The grains of gold upon their native bed are regarded as mere dust; and the aloes-wood, where it groweth, is a kind of firewood:</span>
<span class="i0">If exported, it becometh an object of high demand; but if not, it attaineth no kind of distinction.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then ordered one of his young men to saddle for him a dapple
mule, tall, and of quick pace; and he did so, placing upon her a
saddle adorned with gold, with stirrups of Indian steel, and housings
of the velvet of I&#7779;pah&aacute;n; and she resembled a bride displayed before
her husband. He ordered him also to place upon her a carpet of silk,
and a prayer-carpet,<a href="#IV17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and to put the saddle-bags beneath the latter;
and when this was done, he said to the young man and the slaves, I
have a desire to take a ride for my amusement outside the city, towards
the province of &#7730;alyoob, and shall be absent three nights; and let
none of you follow me, for my heart is contracted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 598px; position: relative;"><a name="f91" id="f91"></a><img src="images/fig091.png" width="598" height="325" alt="The Pyramids" title="The Pyramids" /></div>

<p>Having thus said, he mounted his mule in haste, and, taking with
him a small supply of food, departed from the city, turning his face
towards the open country. The hour of noon overtook him not until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
he entered the city of Bilbeys, where he alighted to repose himself and
rest his mule, and ate; after which he took from this place what he
required for himself, and some provender for his mule, and, having
placed these provisions upon her, went forth again into the plain, and
before noon on the second following day, he entered Jerusalem.<a href="#IV18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Here
he alighted again, and rested himself and his beast, and ate: he then
placed his saddle-bags under his head, and spread his carpet, and
slept, still overcome by anger. He passed the night in this place;
and in the morning he remounted, and he continued to urge on his
mule until he arrived at Aleppo,<a href="#IV19" class="fnanchor">19</a> where he alighted at a &#7730;h&aacute;n, and
remained three days to give rest to himself and his mule, and to enjoy
the air of the place: which having done, he determined to prosecute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>his journey, and mounted his mule, and went forth. He knew not
whither to direct his course; but travelled on until he arrived at the
city of El-Ba&#7779;rah; and scarcely was he aware that the night had overtaken
him, when he alighted there at a Kh&aacute;n, where he took off the
saddle-bags from the mule, and spread the prayer-carpet, committing
the mule, with her equipage, to the care of the door-keeper, and ordering
him to walk her about a little.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 523px; position: relative;"><a name="f92" id="f92"></a><img src="images/fig092.png" width="523" height="627" alt="The Mule of Noor-ed-Deen" title="The Mule of Noor-ed-Deen" /></div>

<p>The door-keeper did so; and it happened that the Wezeer of El-Ba&#7779;rah,
sitting at a window of his palace, saw the mule, and, observing
her costly equipage, thought that she must belong to some Wezeer or
King; and as he attentively regarded her he was surprised, and said to
one of his pages, Bring before me that door-keeper. So the page
went and brought him; and the door-keeper, approaching, kissed the
ground before him. The Wezeer, who was an aged person, then said
to this man, Who is the owner of this mule, and what is his appearance?&mdash;O
my lord, answered the door-keeper, her owner is a young
man of elegant person, of the sons of the merchants, and of a dignified
and grave aspect. On hearing this, the Wezeer arose, and, mounting
his horse,<a href="#IV20" class="fnanchor">20</a> went to the Kh&aacute;n, and introduced himself to the young
man, who, as soon as he saw him approaching, rose to meet him, and
embraced him. The Wezeer, after he had alighted from his horse,
saluted him and welcomed him, and, seating him by his side, said to
him, Whence, O my son, hast thou come; and for what purpose?&mdash;O
my lord, answered Noor-ed-Deen, I have come from the city of Cairo:
my father was Wezeer there; and he hath departed to receive the
mercy of God;&mdash;and he informed him of all that had happened to him
from first to last, adding, I have determined that I will not return until
I shall have seen all the cities and countries of the world.&mdash;O my son,
replied the Wezeer, obey not the suggestions of thy mind, lest thou
expose thyself to destruction; for the countries are waste, and I fear
on thy account the issues of fortune. So saying, he ordered that
the saddle-bags should be placed again on the mule, together with the
carpet of silk and the prayer-carpet, and took Noor-ed-Deen with him
to his house, where he lodged him in an elegant apartment, and treated
him with honour and kindness; and, conceiving a strong affection for
him, said to him, O my son, I have become an old man, and I have
no male child; God, however, hath blessed me with a daughter who
resembleth thee in comeliness, and I have rejected many persons who
have been her suitors: but now, love for thee hath entered my heart;
wilt thou then take my daughter as thy hand-maid to serve thee, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
be her husband? If thou consent to this, I will go up to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n
of El-Ba&#7779;rah, and will say to him, This is the son of my brother;&mdash;and
I will introduce thee to him, that I may make thee Wezeer in my
place, and I will remain in my house; for I am now aged.&mdash;Noor-ed-Deen,
on hearing this proposal of the Wezeer of El-Ba&#7779;rah, hung down
his head, and then answered, I hear and obey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px; position: relative;"><a name="f93" id="f93"></a><img src="images/fig093.png" width="382" height="248" alt="Noor-ed-Deen after the Bath" title="Noor-ed-Deen after the Bath" /></div>

<p>The Wezeer rejoiced at his assent, and ordered his servants to
prepare for him a repast, and to decorate the great saloon<a href="#IV21" class="fnanchor">21</a> which was
furnished for the reception of the chiefs of the Emeers. He then called
together his friends, and invited the great officers of the state, and the
merchants of El-Ba&#7779;rah; and when they had come into his presence,
he said to them, I had a brother who was Wezeer in the land of Egypt,
and God blessed him with two sons; and me, as ye know, He hath
blessed with a daughter: now my brother enjoined me to marry
my daughter to one of his sons, and I consented to do so; and when
she attained a fit age for marriage, he sent to me one of his sons, who
is this young man here present. As soon, therefore, as he had come,
I desired to perform the marriage-contract between him and my
daughter, and that he should introduce himself to her here in my
house.&mdash;Excellently hast thou done! they replied. They then drank
sherbet of sugar, and the pages sprinkled rose-water upon them, and
they departed: after which, the Wezeer ordered his servants to conduct
Noor-en-Deen to the bath, and gave him a suit of his best clothes,<a href="#IV22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
and sent to him the napkins and cups and perfuming-vessels, and
everything else that he required. So when he came out from the bath,
he put on the suit of clothes, and appeared like the full moon; and he
mounted his mule, and, returning to the palace, alighted and presented
himself before the Wezeer, and kissed his hand: and the Wezeer
welcomed him, saying, Arise, and introduce thyself this night to thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
wife; and to-morrow I will go up with thee to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and I pray
that God may bless thee with every kind of happiness. Noor-ed-Deen
therefore arose, and went to his wife, the daughter of the Wezeer.&mdash;Thus
did it happen to Noor-ed-Deen.</p>

<p>As to his brother, he continued a while journeying with the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n,
and when he returned, and found not his brother, he inquired of the
servants respecting him, and they answered, On the day of thy
departure with the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, he mounted his mule, caparisoned as for
a procession of state, and said, I am going towards the province of
&#7730;alyoob, and shall be absent a day or two days; for my heart is contracted;
therefore let none of you follow me:&mdash;and from the day on
which he went forth, to the present day, we have heard no tidings of
him. Upon this the heart of Shems-ed-Deen was troubled at the
separation of his brother, and he grieved excessively for his loss, saying
within himself, The cause of this is nothing else than my having
spoken harshly to him in my conversation on the night before my
departure with the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n; and probably his mind was disturbed, and
he went on a journey: I must therefore send after him. He then
went up and related this event to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, who wrote letters and
sent them to his vicegerents in all the provinces: but Noor-ed-Deen
had traversed distant regions during the absence of his brother with
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n: therefore the messengers, when they had gone with the
letters, returned without having obtained any information respecting
him. So Shems-ed-Deen despaired of his brother, and said, I have
enraged my brother by what I said to him concerning the marriage of
the children. Would that I had not done so! This was not occasioned
but by my want of sense and judgment!&mdash;And soon after this, he
demanded in marriage the daughter of one of the merchants of Cairo,
and performed the marriage-contract between himself and her, and
introduced himself to her: and it happened that the night when this
event took place was the same night on which Noor-ed-Deen introduced
himself to his wife, the daughter of the Wezeer of El-Ba&#7779;rah: this
being in accordance with the will of God, whose name be exalted, that
He might execute his decree upon his creatures.</p>

<p>The event was as they both had said: for it came to pass that the
two wives conceived by them: the wife of Shems-ed-Deen, the Wezeer,
of Egypt, gave birth to a daughter, than whom there was not seen, in
that country, one more beautiful; and the wife of Noor-ed-Deen gave
birth to a son, one more beautiful than whom was not seen in his time:
as the poet hath said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If beauty came to be compared with him, it would hang down its head in shame;</span>
<span class="i0">Or if it were said, O beauty, hast thou seen the like?&mdash;it would answer, The equal of this I have not.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So they named him &#7716;asan;<a href="#IV23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and on the seventh day after his birth,
they made entertainments and spread repasts such as were fit for the
sons of Kings<a href="#IV24" class="fnanchor">24</a> after which the Wezeer of El-Ba&#7779;rah took with him
Noor-ed-Deen, and went up with him to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n; and when he
came into his presence he kissed the ground before him; and Noor-ed-Deen,
being eloquent in tongue, and firm of heart, and comely in
person and in actions, recited these words of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is he whose justice extendeth to all men, and who hath overrun and subdued every region.</span>
<span class="i0">Be thankful for his benefits; for they are not mere benefits; but they are strings of jewels on the necks of his people;</span>
<span class="i0">And kiss his fingers; for they are not mere fingers; but they are the keys of the supplies of Providence.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Sul&#7789;&aacute;n treated them both with honour, and, having thanked
Noor-ed-Deen for his address, said to his Wezeer, Who is this young
man? The Wezeer therefore related to him his story from beginning
to end, and added, This is the son of my brother.&mdash;How is it, said the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, that he is the son of thy brother, and we have not before heard
of him? The Wezeer answered, O our lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, I had a
brother who was Wezeer in the land of Egypt, and he died, leaving two
sons: the elder succeeded to his father's office, as Wezeer, and this his
younger son came to me; and I swore that I would not marry my
daughter to any but him: so, when he came, I married him to her.
He is a young man, and I am now aged; my hearing is impaired, and
my judgment faileth: it is my wish, therefore, that our lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n
would instate him in my office, seeing that he is the son of my brother
and the husband of my daughter, and a person worthy of the dignity
of Wezeer; for he is endowed with knowledge and judgment.&mdash;The
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, upon this, looked towards him, and, being pleased with him,
approved of the advice of the Wezeer that he should promote him to
that office; so he bestowed it upon him, and ordered that a magnificent
dress of honour should be given to him, and one of the best of the
mules upon which he was himself accustomed to ride, allotting him also
supplies and salaries; and Noor-ed-Deen kissed the hand of the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and descended with his father-in-law to their house, both in
high delight, and saying, Verily the birth of this child is fortunate.
On the following day Noor-ed-Deen went again to the King, and
kissed the ground, and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n ordered him to sit in the place of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
the Wezeer: so he sat, and occupied himself with the affairs of his
office, and examined the cases of the people, and their suits, according
to the custom of Wezeers: and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, observing him, was surprised
at his conduct, and the acuteness of his understanding, and his
good judgment. He attentively considered his qualities, and loved
him, and advanced him in his favour: and when the court was dissolved,
Noor-ed-Deen returned to his house, and related what had
passed to his father-in-law, who was rejoiced at hearing it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px; position: relative;"><a name="f94" id="f94"></a><img src="images/fig094.png" width="500" height="360" alt="The Old Wezeer instructing his Grandchild" title="The Old Wezeer instructing his Grandchild" /></div>

<p>The old Wezeer ceased not to superintend the rearing of the child,
who was named &#7716;asan, for many days, while Noor-ed-Deen was constantly
occupied with the affairs of his office, so that he left not the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n by day nor by night; and the King increased his salaries and
supplies until his circumstances became ample: he had ships which
made voyages under his orders with merchandise and other things,
and he founded numerous estates, and made water-wheels<a href="#IV25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and gardens.
Thus did he until his son &#7716;asan was four years of age, when the old
Wezeer, the father of his wife, died; and he conveyed his corpse with
great pomp, and decently deposited it in the earth. He then turned
his thoughts towards the education of his son; and when the child
had gained strength, he brought him a tutor to teach him in his own
house, charging him to instruct him and educate him well; and the
tutor did so, and taught him various useful sciences, after he had
passed some years in learning the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n. &#7716;asan meanwhile increased
in loveliness and beauty, and elegance of person. The tutor continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
to educate him in his father's palace; and from the time that he
arrived at adolescence he went not out of the Wezeer's palace, until
his father took him one day, and, having clad him in one of the richest
of his dresses, mounted him on one of his best mules, and conducted
him to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and introduced him. When the King beheld
&#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen,<a href="#IV26" class="fnanchor">26</a> the son of the Wezeer Noor-ed-Deen, he was
astonished at his beauty; and the people, when he passed by them
for the first time, going up with his father to the King, were amazed
at his surpassing beauty and loveliness, and elegance of person. The
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, as soon as he saw him, loved him, and bestowed marks of
favour upon him, and said to his father, O Wezeer, thou must bring
him with thee every day. The Wezeer answered, I hear and obey;&mdash;and
returned with his son to his abode; and he continued every day
to go up with him to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n until the youth attained the age of
fifteen years.</p>

<p>His father, the Wezeer Noor-ed-Deen, then fell sick, and called
him into his presence, and said to him, O my son, know that this world
is a perishable abode, and the world to come is an everlasting abode.
I wish to give thee some precepts, and do thou understand what I am
about to say to thee, and incline thy heart to it.&mdash;And he began to
counsel him respecting the proper mode of conducting himself in
society, and the due management of his affairs; and when he had done
so, he reflected upon his brother and his native place and country, and
wept at the thought of his separation from those he loved; his tears
flowing: and he said, O my son, hear my words. I have a brother<a href="#IV27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
in Cairo, and I quitted him and departed against his will.&mdash;He then
took a piece of paper,<a href="#IV28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and wrote upon it all that had happened to
him from first to last, together with the date of his marriage and introduction
to the daughter of the Wezeer, and the date of his arrival at
El-Ba&#7779;rah and his interview with its Wezeer; and, having added some
strict admonition, he said to his son, Keep this charge, for the paper
on which it is written containeth an account of thine origin and thy
rank and lineage; and if any evil accident befall thee, repair to Cairo,
and inquire for thine uncle, and salute him, and inform him that I
died in a strange land, ardently desiring that I could see him. Therefore
&#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen took the paper, and, having folded it, and
wrapped it in a piece of waxed cloth,<a href="#IV29" class="fnanchor">29</a> sewed it between the lining and
the outer cloth of his cap,<a href="#IV30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and wept for his father, that he should be
parted from him in his youth.</p>

<p>Noor-ed-Deen then said to his son,<a href="#IV31" class="fnanchor">31</a> I charge thee that thou be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
not familiar with any one; for in retirement is security. Divinely
gifted was the poet who said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is none in thy time whose friendship thou shouldst covet; nor any intimate who, when fortune is treacherous, will be faithful.</span>
<span class="i0">Live then apart, and rely upon no man: I have given thee, in these words, good advice, and sufficient.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Accustom thyself to taciturnity: occupy thyself with thine own affairs,
and use not many words: for the poet saith,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Taciturnity is an ornament, and in silence is security: therefore, when thou speakest, be not loquacious:</span>
<span class="i0">For if thou repent once of thy silence, thou wilt assuredly repent many times of thy speech.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beware of drinking wine; for it is the source of every kind of mischief.
The poet<a href="#IV32" class="fnanchor">32</a> saith on this subject,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have abandoned wine and those who drink it; and have become the friend of such as condemn it.</span>
<span class="i0">Wine leadeth astray from the path of rectitude, and openeth the doors to evil.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hate no man, and oppress none; for oppression is base. The poet
saith,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oppress not if thou hast the power to do so; for oppression will eventually bring thee repentance:</span>
<span class="i0">Thine eye will sleep while the oppressed, wakeful, will call for vengeance upon thee; and the eye of God sleepeth not.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Despise thy wealth, but not thyself: yet bestow not wealth save upon
him who deserveth it. If thou keep it, it will keep thee; but if thou
squander it, it will ruin thee; and then wilt thou need the assistance
of the least of mankind. It hath been said by the poet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When my wealth faileth, no friend assisteth me; but when it aboundeth, all men are my friends.</span>
<span class="i0">How many enemies for the sake of wealth have consorted with me! And my companion, in the time of want, hath abandoned me!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this manner he continued to admonish his son &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen
until his spirit departed. The house became a scene of mourning,
and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n and all the Emeers grieved for him; and they
buried him. They continued their mourning during a period of two
months, and the son of Noor-ed-Deen rode not out nor went to the
court nor presented himself before the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n; and the King instated
one of the Chamberlains in his place, and appointed a new Wezeer in
the place of his father, and ordered this Wezeer to put seals upon all
the houses of Noor-ed-Deen, and upon his wealth and all his buildings
and other possessions.<a href="#IV33" class="fnanchor">33</a> So the new Wezeer went with the Chamber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>lains
to the house of the Wezeer Noor-ed-Deen, to seal its door and to
arrest his son &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, and bring him before the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n,
that he might do to him what his judgment required. But there was
among the troops one of the memlooks of the deceased Wezeer Noor-ed-Deen;
and he could not endure that the son of his master should
be thus treated: he therefore repaired to &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, whom
he found with downcast head and mourning heart, on account of the
death of his father, and acquainted him with what had passed. &#7716;asan
asked him, Will the execution of the order be delayed long enough for
me to enter my house,<a href="#IV34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and take somewhat of my worldly possessions
by which to obtain support during my exile? But the memlook
answered, Save thyself:&mdash;and when &#7716;asan heard these words, he
covered his head with the skirt of his robe, and, going forth on foot,
fled of the city: and he heard the people saying, The Sul&#7789;&aacute;n hath
sent the new Wezeer to the house of the deceased Wezeer, to seal his
wealth and other possessions, and to arrest his son &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen,
and bring him before him that he may put him to death:&mdash;and
the people were mourning for him on account of his beauty and loveliness.
So when he heard what they said, he took a course that he had
not intended, and, not knowing whither to go, walked on until destiny
urged him to the tomb of his father.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 544px; position: relative;"><a name="f95" id="f95"></a><img src="images/fig095.png" width="544" height="345" alt="Noor-ed-Deen and his Son" title="Noor-ed-Deen and his Son" /></div>

<p>Entering the burial-ground, he bent his way among the tombs
until he seated himself at that of his father, where he removed his
skirt from over his head. And as he was sitting there, a Jew of El-Ba&#7779;rah
approached, and said to him, Wherefore, O my master, do I
see thee thus changed? He answered, I was just now sleeping, and I
beheld my father reproaching me for having failed to visit his tomb:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
wherefore I rose in alarm, fearing that the day would pass without
my visiting it, and so the occurrence would distress me. The Jew
then said to him, O my master, thy father despatched some vessels
with merchandise, and some of them have returned; and it is my wish
to purchase of thee the cargo of every vessel that hath arrived for a
thousand pieces of gold;&mdash;and so saying, he took out a purse filled
with gold, and counted out from it a thousand pieces, which he paid to
&#7716;asan the son of the Wezeer, and said to him, Write me a paper, and
seal it. So &#7716;asan took a paper, and wrote upon it, The writer of this
paper, &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, the son of the Wezeer Noor-ed-Deen, hath
sold to the Jew such a one the whole cargo of every one of his father's
vessels that hath returned from her voyage, for a thousand pieces of
gold, and hath received the price in advance. And after he had taken
a copy<a href="#IV35" class="fnanchor">35</a> of it, the Jew went away with the paper; and &#7716;asan wept,
reflecting upon his former state of dignity and favour. At length the
night closed in upon him, and sleep overtook him, and he remained
asleep at his father's tomb until the moon rose when his head rolled
from the tomb, and he lay and slept on his back, his face shining in
the moonlight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 558px; position: relative;"><a name="f96" id="f96"></a><img src="images/fig096.png" width="558" height="676" alt="Bedr-ed-Deen at his Father's Tomb" title="Bedr-ed-Deen at his Father's Tomb" /></div>

<p>Now the burial-ground was inhabited by believing Jinn; and a
Jinneeyeh, coming forth, saw the face of &#7716;asan as he lay asleep, and
when she beheld him, was surprised at his beauty and loveliness, and
exclaimed, Extolled be Allah's perfection! This youth is like none
but the virgins of paradise!&mdash;She then soared into the air, to perform
her accustomed circuits, and saw an 'Efreet on his flight. She saluted
him, and he returned her salutation; and she said to him, Whence
comest thou? He answered from Cairo:&mdash;and she said to him, Wilt
thou go with me to behold the beauty of the youth who is sleeping
in the burial-ground? He replied, Yes. So they went together; and
when they had descended into the burial-ground, she said to him,
Hast thou seen in the course of thy life a person like this?&mdash;And the
'Efreet looked upon him, and exclaimed, Extolled be the perfection of
Him unto whom none is to be compared! But, O my sister, he
added, if thou desire, I will relate to thee what I have seen.&mdash;Tell me,
she replied: so he said, I have seen a person resembling this youth in
the land of Egypt; and that person is the daughter of the Wezeer.
The King had heard of her, and demanded her of her father, the
Wezeer Shems-ed-Deen, in marriage; but he answered him, O our lord
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, accept my excuse, and pity my grief; for thou knowest
that my brother Noor-ed-Deen departed from us, and we know not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
where he is; and that he shared with me the office of Wezeer; and
the cause of his departure was this, that I was sitting conversing with
him on the subject of marriage, and he was angry with me, and in
anger went away:&mdash;and he related to the King all that had passed
between them; adding, This was the cause of his indignation, and I
have been under an oath that I will not marry my daughter to any
but the son of my brother from the day that her mother gave birth to
her; and that was about fifteen years ago: and lately I heard that my
brother had married the daughter of the Wezeer of El-Ba&#7779;rah, and
obtained a son by her; and I will not marry my daughter to any but
him, in honour of my brother. After I had heard this, I recorded the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
date of my marriage, and of my wife's conception, and of the birth of
this daughter: she is intended for the son of her uncle; and of other
maidens there are plenty.&mdash;But when the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n heard these words of
the Wezeer, he was violently enraged, and said, How is it that such a
one as myself demandeth in marriage a daughter from one like thee,
and thou withholdest her from him, and excusest thyself by an absurd
pretext? By my head, I will not marry her but to one of less consideration
than myself, in scorn of thy pride!&mdash;And the King had a
humpbacked groom, with a hump before and a hump behind; and he
ordered him to be brought, and affianced him to the daughter of the
Wezeer, commanding that he should introduce himself to her this night,
and be conducted in pompous procession. I left him in the midst of
the memlooks of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, who were surrounding him with lighted
candles in their hands, laughing at him and mocking him, at the door
of the bath, while the daughter of the Wezeer was sitting weeping in
the midst of the dye-women<a href="#IV36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and tire-women.<a href="#IV37" class="fnanchor">37</a> She resembles more
than any other person this youth. They have prohibited her father
from going to her; and I have never seen, O my sister, a more ugly
wretch than this humpback: but as to the maiden, she is more beautiful
than this youth.</p>

<p>To this story of the 'Efreet, the Jinneeyeh answered, Thou liest;
for this youth is the most beautiful of the people of his age. But the
'Efreet replied, By Allah, O my sister, the maiden is more beautiful
than he: however, none but he is suited to her; for they resemble
each other, and probably are brother and sister, or cousins; and how
will she be thrown away upon this humpback! She therefore said to
him, O my brother, let us place ourselves beneath him and lift him up
and take him to the maiden of whom thou speakest, and see which of
the two is more beautiful. The 'Efreet answered, I hear and obey:
this proposal is right, and there can be no better determination than
this which thou hast chosen; therefore I will carry him. So he lifted
him up, and soared into the sky, and the Jinneeyeh flew by his side
until he descended with him in the city of Cairo, where he placed him
upon a ma&#7779;&#7789;abah,<a href="#IV38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and roused him from his sleep.<a href="#IV39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, he awoke, and found that he was not at his
father's tomb in the land of El-Ba&#7779;rah, he looked to the right and left,
and perceived that he was in a city that was not El-Ba&#7779;rah, and would
have cried out, but the 'Efreet winked to him, and, lighting for him
a candle, said to him, Know that I have brought thee hither, and I
desire to do thee a service for the sake of God: take, therefore, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
candle, and go with it to yonder bath, and mix with the people there,
and proceed with them until thou arrivest at the saloon of the bride;
then go before, and enter the saloon, and fear no one; and when thou
hast entered, station thyself on the right of the humpbacked bridegroom;
and whenever the tire-women and singing-women and dye-women
come to thee, put thy hand into thy pocket: thou wilt find it
full of gold, and do thou take it by the handful and throw it to them;
and imagine not that thou wilt put thy hand in and not find it filled
with gold: give therefore to every one who cometh to thee by the
handful, and fear nothing; but rely upon Him who created thee; for
this will not be through thine own strength or power, but through
the strength of God, and his power.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 538px; position: relative;"><a name="f97" id="f97"></a><img src="images/fig097.png" width="538" height="576" alt="The 'Efreet, attended by the Jinneeyeh, carrying off Bedr-ed-Deen" title="The 'Efreet, attended by the Jinneeyeh, carrying off Bedr-ed-Deen" /></div>

<p>On hearing these words of the 'Efreet, &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen said,
What is this event, and what manner of kindness is this? And he
went with his candle to the bath, where he found the humpback
mounted on his horse; and he joined himself to the party, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
same garb in which he had arrived, and with the same comely appearance;
being attired with a &#7789;arboosh<a href="#IV40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and turban, and a farajeeyeh<a href="#IV41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
interwoven with gold. He proceeded with the pompous train, and
every time that the singing-women stopped for the people to give
them money, he put his hand into his pocket, and found it filled with
gold, and took it by the handful and threw it into the tambourine,<a href="#IV42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
for the singing-women and tire-women, filling the tambourine with
pieces of gold: and the singing-women were amazed, and the people
wondered at his beauty and loveliness. Thus he continued to do
until they arrived at the house of the Wezeer, when the chamberlains
drove back the people, and prevented their entrance; but the singing-women
and tire-women said, By Allah, we will not enter unless this
youth enter with us, for he hath overwhelmed us with his favours, and
the bride shall not be displayed unless he be present:&mdash;and upon this
they entered with him into the saloon of the festivity, and seated him,
in spite of the humpbacked bridegroom. All the ladies of the Emeers
and Wezeers and Chamberlains were ranged in two rows, each lady
holding a large lighted candle, and having her head-veil drawn across
the lower part of her face: thus they stood in two rows, to the right
and the left, from the foot of the couch of the bride to the upper end
of the leew&aacute;n that adjoined the chamber from which the bride was to
come forth. And when the ladies beheld &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen and
his beauty and loveliness, his face shining like the crescent of the
moon, the hearts of all of them inclined to him, and the female singers
said to all the women who were present, Know that this charming
youth hath given us nothing but red gold; therefore fail not to serve
him properly, and obey him in whatever he shall say. The women
crowded round him to gaze at his charms, and their minds were overpowered
by astonishment at his beauty, and each of them wished that
she might be in his bosom for a year or a month or an hour: they
removed the veils from their faces, and their hearts were perplexed,
and they said, Joy to the person to whom this youth belongeth, or to
the person over whom he is lord! Then they imprecated evil upon the
humpbacked groom and him who was the cause of his marriage to that
lovely maiden; and every time that they prayed for blessings upon
&#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, they imprecated misfortunes upon the humpback.</p>

<p>The singing-women then beat the tambourines, and the tire-women
approached with the daughter of the Wezeer in the midst of
them. They had perfumed her with sweet scents and essences, and
clad her, and adorned her hair and neck with various ornaments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
decking her with garments such as were worn by the ancient monarchs
of Persia. Among these was a loose gown embroidered with red gold,
presenting the forms of wild beasts and birds, hanging down over her
other clothes; and round her neck was a necklace worth thousands,
composed of jewels such as neither a King of El-Yemen nor a C&aelig;sar
ever collected: she was like the moon shining in its fourteenth
night, and when she approached she resembled a &#7716;ooreeyeh.<a href="#IV43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Extolled
be the perfection of him who created her so splendid a being!
The women encompassed her, and appeared like stars; she, in the
midst of them, being as the moon when the clouds have withdrawn
from before it. Meanwhile, &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen remained sitting,
with the company gazing at him; and as the bride approached with a
dignified and graceful gait, the humpbacked groom rose to her, to kiss
her; but she turned aside from him, and went and stood before
&#7716;asan, the son of her uncle. The company laughed at this; and
when they beheld her turn towards &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, and saw him
put his hand into his pocket and take out handfuls of gold and throw
it into the tambourine of the singing-women, they were delighted, and
said, We wish that this bride were thine:&mdash;and he smiled. All this
time the humpbacked groom was alone, looking like an ape; and
every time that they lighted his candle it went out again, and he was
confounded, and remained sitting in the dark, full of secret indignation,
with all the company surrounding him, while the lighted candles
presented an appearance of beauty that was most admirable, so that
every person of reflection was amazed at their splendour. But as to
the bride, she raised her hands towards heaven, and said, O Allah,
make this to be my husband, and relieve me from this humpbacked
groom!&mdash;The tire-women then proceeded to display the bride in
different dresses, to the seventh suit, before &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen of
El-Ba&#7779;rah, the humpbacked groom remaining alone; and when they
had finished this ceremony they gave permission to the company to
depart: so all who were present at the festivity, both women and
children, went out, except &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen and the humpbacked
groom; after which the tire-women conducted the bride to an
inner chamber, to take off her ornaments and outer robes, and to
prepare her for the bridegroom's visit.</p>

<p>Upon this, the humpbacked groom approached &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen,
and said to him, O my master, thou hast made us happy by thy
company this night, and overwhelmed us with thy favours; but now
wherefore dost thou not rise and go to thy house without thy being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
ejected? He answered, In the name of Allah;&mdash;and rose, and went
out from the door: but the 'Efreet met him, and said unto him, Stay,
O Bedr-ed-Deen; and when the humpback retires into the private
closet, enter thou and seat thyself in the bride-chamber; and when the
bride cometh, say to her, I am thy husband; and the King had not
recourse to this stratagem from any other motive than his fearing for
thee the effect of the eye;<a href="#IV44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and this whom thou hast seen is one of
our grooms:&mdash;then approach her, and uncover her face, and fear no
evil from any one.</p>

<p>While Bedr-ed-Deen was thus conversing with the 'Efreet, lo, the
groom entered the closet, and seated himself; and immediately the
'Efreet rose before him, from the trough of water that was in the
closet,<a href="#IV45" class="fnanchor">45</a> in the form of a mouse, and

<span class="figleft2" style="width: 215px; position: relative;"><a name="f98a" id="f98a"></a><img src="images/fig098a.png" width="215" height="473" alt="Transformations" title="Transformations" /></span>
<span class="figleft3" style="width: 359px; position: relative;"><a name="f98b" id="f98b"></a><img src="images/fig098b.png" width="359" height="181" alt="Transformations" title="Transformations" /></span>

cried Zeek!&mdash;What brought thee here?
said the humpback.  The mouse then
increased in size, and became like a cat;
and then increased, and became a dog,
and cried, 'Owh! 'Owh! At the sight of
this the groom was terrified, and exclaimed,
Get away, thou unlucky!<a href="#IV46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
The dog, however, still increased and
swelled until it became an ass, and
brayed in his face, crying, H&aacute;&#7731;! H&aacute;&#7731;!&mdash;upon
which the groom, in terror, cried
out, Come to my aid, O people of the
house! But lo, the ass increased, and
became like a buffalo, and, stopping up
the place before him, spoke with the
speech of a son of Adam, and said, Wo
be to thee, O humpback!  O filthiest
of grooms! Upon this the groom was
seized with a colick, and seated himself
upon the slabs, and his teeth knocked
together. The 'Efreet
then said to him.
Hath the earth become
narrow to thee,
that  thou  wouldst
marry none but my
mistress?  But the

<span class="figleft" style="width: 173px; position: relative;"><a name="f99" id="f99"></a><img src="images/fig099.png" width="173" height="310" alt="Transformations" title="Transformations" /></span>

groom  was  silent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Return me an answer, said the 'Efreet, or I
will make thine abode to be in the dust!&mdash;By
Allah, then answered the groom, I am not
in fault; for they compelled me, and I knew
not that she had a lover among the buffaloes;
but now I repent before Allah and before thee.
Then the 'Efreet said, I swear by Allah that if
thou depart now from this place, or utter a

<span class="figright" style="width: 208px; position: relative;"><a name="f100" id="f100"></a><img src="images/fig100.png" width="208" height="619" alt="Bedr-ed-Deen and his Bride" title="Bedr-ed-Deen and his Bride" /></span>

word before the sun hath risen, I will slay
thee: and when the sun hath risen go thy
way, and never return to this house. And he
seized the humpbacked groom, and, placing
his head upside
down upon the
slabs, and his feet upwards, said to him,
Remain here, and I will watch thee until
sunrise.&mdash;Thus did it happen to the
humpback.</p>

<p>Now, as to &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen of
El-Ba&#7779;rah, he left the humpback and
the 'Efreet contending together, and,
entering the house, seated himself in the
bride-chamber; and lo, the bride approached,
accompanied by an old woman,
who stopped at the door of the chamber,
and said, O Aboo-Shih&aacute;b,<a href="#IV47" class="fnanchor">47</a> rise, and
take thy bride; and I commend thee to
the care of Allah. Then the old woman
went away, and the bride, whose name
was Sitt-el-&#7716;osn,<a href="#IV48" class="fnanchor">48</a> advanced to the upper
end of the chamber. Her heart was
broken, and she said within herself, By
Allah, I will not suffer him to caress me
though my spirit depart from me! But
when she had proceeded to the upper
end of the chamber, she beheld Bedr-ed-Deen,
and said, My beloved, until this
hour art thou remaining? I had said
within myself, perhaps thou and the
humpbacked groom are to share me
between you.&mdash;What, said he, should give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
the groom access to thee, and wherefore should he be my partner in
the possession of thee?&mdash;Who, then, she asked, is my husband?
Thou or he?&mdash;O my mistress, answered Bedr-ed-Deen, we did not
this for any other purpose than to make a jest of him, and that we
might laugh at him; for when the tire-women and the singing-women
and thy family beheld thine admirable beauty, they feared
for us the effect of the eye, and thy father hired him for ten pieces
of gold, in order that he might divert from us the eye; and now he
hath departed. When Sitt-el-&#7716;osn heard these words of Bedr-ed-Deen,
she smiled, and uttered a gentle laugh, and said, By Allah,
thou hast extinguished my fire! Take me then, I conjure thee, and
press me to thy bosom.&mdash;And they embraced each other.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the 'Efreet said to the Jinneeyeh, Arise, and
place thyself beneath the youth, and let us convey him back, lest the
morning overtake us; for the time is near. So she advanced towards
him, and, placing herself beneath his skirt, as he lay asleep, took him
up, and flew away with him, in the state in which she found him, clad
only in his shirt, and pursued her flight with the 'Efreet by her side.
But God gave permission to some angels to cast at the 'Efreet a
shooting-star of fire, and he was burnt. The Jinneeyeh, however,
escaped unhurt, and deposited Bedr-ed-Deen in the place over which
the shooting-star had burnt the 'Efreet. She would not pass beyond
it, fearing for his safety; and as destiny had appointed, this place
was Damascus: so she placed him by one of the gates of this city,
and flew away.</p>

<p>When daylight therefore came, and the gates were opened, the
people, coming forth, beheld a beautiful youth clad in his shirt, and
with a cotton skull-cap without a turban. In consequence of his
having been so long wakeful, he was now immersed in sleep; and
when the people saw him, some said, Would that he had waited till he
had put on his clothes!&mdash;another said, Objects of pity are the children
of men of condition! Probably this youth hath just come forth from
his drinking-place, on account of some business, and intoxication hath
overcome him, and he hath wandered from the place to which he would
go until he arrived at the gate of the city, and, finding it locked, hath
slept here.&mdash;They had expressed various opinions respecting him, and
were wondering at his case, when Bedr-ed-Deen awoke. Perceiving
that he was at the gate of a city, and surrounded by men, he was
astonished, and said, Where am I, O good people; and what is the
cause of your assembling around me, and what hath befallen me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
among you? They answered, We saw thee at the call to morning-prayer
lying at this gate asleep; and we know nothing more of thy
case. Where wast thou sleeping this last night?&mdash;By Allah, O people,
he replied, I was sleeping this last night in Cairo.&mdash;On hearing this,
one of them said, Dost thou eat &#7717;asheesh?<a href="#IV49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Another said, Thou art
mad. How couldst thou be passing the night in Cairo, and be
sleeping in the morning at the city of Damascus?&mdash;He said to them,
By Allah, O good people, I will tell you no falsehood: I was last
night in the land of Egypt, and the day before I was at El-Ba&#7779;rah.
One of them said, This is a wonderful thing! Another said, This
youth is mad. And they clapped their hands at him, and, conversing
together, said, Alas, for his youth! By Allah, there is no denying
his madness!&mdash;They then said to him, Return to thy reason. But he
replied, I was yesterday a bridegroom in the land of Egypt.&mdash;Probably
thou hast dreamt, said they, and hast seen this of which thou speakest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
in thy sleep. And &#7716;asan was confounded, and said, By Allah, this
was not a dream: and where is the humpbacked groom who was sitting
with us, and the purse of gold that I had? And where are my clothes
and my drawers?&mdash;He then rose, and entered the city, and proceeded
through its great thoroughfare-streets and market-streets; and the
people crowded round him and paraded him: so he entered the shop
of a cook. Now this cook was a robber,<a href="#IV50" class="fnanchor">50</a> whom God had caused to
repent of his unlawful actions, and he had opened a cook's shop; and
all the people of Damascus feared him on account of his boldness;
therefore, when they saw that the youth had entered this shop, they
left him, being afraid.</p>

<p>When the cook beheld &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, and observed his
beauty and comeliness, love for him entered his heart, and he said to
him, Whence art thou, O young man? Relate to me thy story; for
thou art become dearer to me than my soul.&mdash;So he related to him all
that had happened, from beginning to end: and the cook said to him,
O my master Bedr-ed-Deen, know that this is a wonderful event and
an extraordinary story; but, O my son, conceal thy case until God
dispel thy trouble, and remain with me in this place; and as I have
not a son, I will adopt thee as such. Bedr-ed-Deen replied, Let it be
as thou desirest, O uncle. And immediately the cook went out to the
mart, and bought for Bedr-ed-Deen costly clothes, and put them on
him: he then went to the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee, and made a declaration that he was
his adopted son:<a href="#IV51" class="fnanchor">51</a> so &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen became known throughout
the city of Damascus as the son of the cook; and he sat with him in
the shop to receive the money, and in this situation he remained.</p>

<p>Now as to Sitt-el-&#7716;osn, when daybreak came and she awoke, she
found not &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen remaining with her, and, imagining
that he would soon return, she sat a while expecting him; and lo, her
father came in to her, troubled at that which had befallen him from
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and at his having married his daughter by force to one of
his servants, the humpbacked groom; and he said within himself, I
will kill this girl if she have suffered the wretch to caress her. So he
advanced to the bride-chamber, and, stopping at the door, said, O
Sitt-el-&#7716;osn! She answered, Well, O my master!&mdash;and came forth
to him, walking with a vacillating gait, through joy, and kissed the
ground before him; and her countenance beamed with increased splendour
in consequence of her union with that gazelle. When her father,
therefore, saw her in this state, he exclaimed to her, O thou base
creature! art thou delighted with this groom? On hearing these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
words of her father, Sitt-el-&#7716;osn smiled, and replied, By Allah, it is
enough that thou hast done, and that the people laugh at me, and
put me on an equality with this groom, who is not, in my estimation,
of the value of a paring of one of my finger-nails; but as to my
husband&mdash;by Allah, I never in the course of my life passed a night
more delightful than that which I have just passed in his company:
therefore jest not with me by mentioning that humpback.&mdash;When her
father heard what she said he was filled with rage; his eyes glared so
that little appeared of them but the white, and he said to her, Wo to
thee! What are these words that thou sayest? Verily the humpbacked
groom hath passed the night with thee!&mdash;I conjure thee by
Allah, she rejoined, that thou mention him not. May Allah reject
him, and reject his father! Continue not then to mock me by mentioning
him; for the groom was only hired for ten pieces of gold, and
he took his hire and departed; and I came and entered the bride-chamber,
and beheld my husband seated, after the singing-women had
displayed me before him; and he threw them red gold until he had
enriched the poor who were present. I have reclined upon the bosom of
my gentle-hearted husband, with the black eyes and the joined eyebrows.&mdash;When
her father heard this, the light became darkness before his
face, and he exclaimed to her, O thou abandoned one! What is this
that thou sayest? Where is thy reason?&mdash;O my father, she replied,
thou hast broken my heart in pieces! Wherefore dost thou pay no
attention? This of whom I spake is my husband, and he hath retired
to his private closet.</p>

<p>So her father went thither, in a state of astonishment, and, entering
the closet, found the humpbacked groom with his head upon the slabs
and his feet turned upwards; and the Wezeer was confounded at the
sight, and said, Is not this the humpback?&mdash;and he spoke to him;
but the humpback returned no answer, thinking that it was the 'Efreet
who addressed him. The Wezeer, therefore, cried out at him with a
loud voice, and said to him, Speak, or I will cut off thy head with this
sword! Upon which the humpback exclaimed, By Allah, O sheykh
of the 'Efreets, from the time that thou placedst me here I have not
raised my head: I conjure thee therefore that thou shew favour to
me!&mdash;The Wezeer, on hearing the humpback thus address him, said
to him, What sayest thou? I am the father of the bride, and I am
not an 'Efreet.&mdash;Then said the humpback, My life is not in thy hand,
nor art thou able to take my soul; so go thy way before he come to
thee who hath treated me in this manner. Ye would not marry me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
to any but the mistress of buffaloes and the mistress of 'Efreets!
May Allah, then, confound him who married me to her, and confound
him who was the cause of it!&mdash;Then did the humpbacked groom
address the Wezeer, the father of the bride, again, saying, Allah confound
him who was the cause of this!&mdash;Rise, said the Wezeer, and
depart from this place.&mdash;Am I mad, he replied, that I should go with
thee without the permission of the 'Efreet? For he said to me, When
the sun shall have risen go thy way.&mdash;Hath the sun then risen or
not? For I cannot depart from my place until the sun hath risen.&mdash;Upon
this the Wezeer said to him, Who brought thee to this place?
He answered, I came hither yesterday, and a dust rose from the midst
of the water, and cried out, and increased in bulk until it became of
the size of a buffalo, and said to me words that entered my ear. Leave
me, therefore, and go. Allah confound the bride and him who married
me to her!&mdash;The Wezeer then approached him, and dragged him forth,
and he went out running, doubting whether the sun had risen, and
went up to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and informed him of that which had happened
to him with the 'Efreet.</p>

<p>But as to the Wezeer, the father of the bride, he returned with his
reason perplexed respecting the case of his daughter, and said to her,
O my daughter, reveal to me thy story. She replied, The elegant
person before whom I was displayed remained with me; and if thou
believe me not, see this is his turban, twisted just as it was, upon the
chair,<a href="#IV52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and his drawers are under the bed, and in them is something
wrapped up: I know not what it is. So, when her father heard this,
he entered the bride-chamber, and found the turban of &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen,
the son of his brother; and taking it up, he turned it over,
and said, This is such a turban as is worn by Wezeers, except that
it is of the M&oacute;&#7779;ilee<a href="#IV53" class="fnanchor">53</a> kind. He then observed an amulet sewed in his
red cloth cap; and he unsewed it; and he took the drawers, and
found the purse containing the thousand pieces of gold, and, opening
this, he discovered in it a paper, which, when he had read it he saw to
be a copy of the Jew's contract, with the name of &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen
the son of Noor-ed-Deen of Cairo; and he found also the thousand
pieces of gold. But when he read the paper he cried aloud and fell
down in a swoon; and as soon as he recovered, and understood the
case, he was astonished, and exclaimed, There is no deity but God,
who is able to do whatsoever He willeth! Then said he, O my
daughter, knowest thou who hath become thy husband? She
answered, No.&mdash;He is the son of my brother, said he, and the son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
thine uncle; and these thousand pieces of gold are thy dowry.
Extolled be the perfection of God! Would that I knew how this
event hath happened!&mdash;Then he opened the amulet that was sewed
up, and found in it a paper written by the hand of his brother Noor-ed-Deen
of Cairo, the father of &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen: and when he
beheld the hand-writing of his brother he repeated this couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I behold their footsteps, and melt with desire, and pour forth my tears upon the places they have trodden,</span>
<span class="i0">Begging of Him who hath afflicted me by their separation, that He will bless me some day by a reunion.</span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 555px; position: relative;"><a name="f102" id="f102"></a><img src="images/fig102.png" width="555" height="391" alt="The Wezeer Shems-ed-Deen recovering from a Swoon" title="The Wezeer Shems-ed-Deen recovering from a Swoon" /></div>

<p>So saying, he read the paper, and found in it the date of his marriage
to the daughter of the Wezeer of El-Ba&#7779;rah, and that of his first
introduction to her, and a record of his age at the time of his death,
and the date of the birth of his son &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen; and he
wondered, and shook with delight; and, comparing what had happened
to his brother with the events that had happened to himself, he found
that they corresponded exactly: his marriage and the marriage of his
brother agreed in date, and their first visits to their respective wives in
like manner; as also the birth of Bedr-ed-Deen, the son of his brother,
and the birth of his daughter Sitt-el-&#7716;osn. He took the two papers,
and, going up with them to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, he acquainted him with all
that had happened from the first of the case to the last; and the King
was astonished, and ordered that the case should be immediately
recorded. The Wezeer then remained in expectation of the son of his
brother; but he met with no tidings of him: so he said, By Allah, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
will do a deed that none hath done before me:&mdash;and he took an ink-case
and a pen, and wrote an inventory of the furniture of the house,
describing the money-chest as having been in such a place, and a
certain curtain in such another place, and everything in the house in
like manner; and he folded up the paper, and ordered that all the
furniture should be stored up; and he took the turban with its
&#7789;arboosh, and also the farajeeyeh and the purse, and kept them
himself.</p>

<p>After this, in due time, the daughter of the Wezeer gave birth to
a son like the moon, resembling his father in beauty and symmetry
and splendour and loveliness. They received him from his mother,
and blackened the edges of his eyes with ko&#7717;l,<a href="#IV54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and delivered him to
the nurses, and named him 'Ajeeb.<a href="#IV55" class="fnanchor">55</a> His day was as a month; and his
month, as a year;<a href="#IV56" class="fnanchor">56</a> and when seven years had passed over him, his
grandfather committed him to a schoolmaster, whom he charged to
educate him with great care. He continued at the school four years,
and used to fight with his schoolfellows, and abuse them, saying to
them, Who among you is like me? I am the son of the Wezeer of
Cairo.&mdash;So the boys went together to complain to the monitor of that
which they suffered from 'Ajeeb; and the monitor said to them, I will
teach you something to say to him when he cometh, and he shall
repent of his coming to the school; and it is this: to-morrow, when
he is come, seat yourselves around him, and say to one another, By
Allah, none shall play with us at this game excepting him who shall
tell us the name of his mother and that of his father; and he who
knoweth not the name of his mother and that of his father is illegitimate;
therefore he shall not play with us. Accordingly, on the
following morning they came to the school, and 'Ajeeb was there;
and the boys surrounded him, and said as the monitor had directed
them, and they all agreed to the proposal; and one said, My name is
M&aacute;jid, and my mother is 'Alawee, and my father is 'Ezz-ed-Deen:&mdash;then
another said after the same manner, and another, and so on, until
the turn came to 'Ajeeb; and he said to them, My name is 'Ajeeb,
and my mother is Sitt-el-&#7716;osn, and my father is Shems-ed-Deen, the
Wezeer of Cairo:&mdash;and they said to him, By Allah, the Wezeer is not
thy father. 'Ajeeb replied, the Wezeer is my father indeed:&mdash;and
upon this the boys laughed at him, and clapped their hands at him,
saying, Thou knowest not who is thy father: get away from us, therefore;
for none shall play with us excepting him who knoweth the
name of his father:&mdash;and immediately the boys dispersed from around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
him, and made a jest of him. In consequence of this treatment his
heart became contracted, and he was almost choked with crying; and
the monitor said to him, Dost thou really consider as thy father him who
is thy grandfather, the Wezeer, the father of thy mother Sitt-el-&#7716;osn?
Thy father thou knowest not, nor do we know him; for the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n married
her to the humpbacked groom, and the Jinn came and prevented
him: so, if thou know not thy father, they will regard thee among
them as illegitimate. Dost thou not see that the son of the woman
who is coveted as a wife knoweth his father? The Wezeer of Cairo is
thy grandfather; and as to thy father, we know him not, nor dost
thou: return therefore to thy reason.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 538px; position: relative;"><a name="f103" id="f103"></a><img src="images/fig103.png" width="538" height="382" alt="The School" title="The School" /></div>

<p>Upon this, 'Ajeeb went immediately to his mother, Sitt-el-&#7716;osn,
and complained to her, and wept; and his weeping prevented his
speaking: and when his mother heard his complaint and his crying,
her heart was inflamed for him, and she said to him, O my son, what
maketh thee weep? Tell me thy story.&mdash;So he told her what he had
heard from the boys and from the monitor, and said to her, O my
mother, who is my father? She answered him, Thy father is the
Wezeer of Cairo. But he said, He is not my father: tell me not,
therefore, what is false; for the Wezeer is thy father; not mine: who
then is my father? If thou do not tell me truly; I will kill myself
with this dagger.&mdash;And when his mother heard the mention of his
father, she wept at the allusion to the son of her uncle, and remembering
the amiable qualities of &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen of El-Ba&#7779;rah, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
what had happened to herself and him, she recited an ode commencing
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They excited love in my heart, and departed; and far distant hath their abode become!</span>
<span class="i0">Reason forsook me when they withdrew, and sleep and patience abandoned me.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And she wept and cried out, and her son did the same; and lo, the
Wezeer entered. His heart burned within him when he beheld their
state, and he said to them, What causeth you to weep? She acquainted
him therefore with the treatment that her son had experienced from
the other boys of the school; and he, also, wept, and called to mind
what had happened to his brother and himself and his daughter, and
he knew not the mystery of the case. Then suddenly he arose, and,
going up to the council-chamber, presented himself before the King,
and related to him the story, begging his permission to travel eastwards
to the city of El-Ba&#7779;rah, that he might make inquiries respecting
the son of his brother; and requesting also of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n that he
would write letters for him to all the countries through which he
might pass, that, if he found the son of his brother in any place, he
might take him away. And he wept before the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and the heart
of the King was moved with compassion for him, and he wrote for
him letters to all the regions and countries; upon which the Wezeer
rejoiced, and, having offered up a prayer for the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, took leave
of him.</p>

<p>He descended immediately and prepared for the journey, and,
taking with him all that he required, together with his daughter and
her son 'Ajeeb, travelled the first day and the second and the third,
and proceeded until he arrived at the city of Damascus, and beheld it
with its trees and streams celebrated by the poets. He alighted in
the open space called Meyd&aacute;n el-&#7716;a&#7779;b&agrave;; and, when he had pitched
his tents, said to his servants, We will take rest here two days. So
the servants entered the city to gratify their various desires; one to
sell, another to buy, a third to enter the bath, and a fourth to visit
the mosque of the Benee-Umeiyeh, which hath not in the world its
equal. 'Ajeeb also entered the city, accompanied by his eunuch, in
order to amuse themselves; and the eunuch walked behind 'Ajeeb,
having in his hand a whip that would strike down a camel. And
when the people of Damascus beheld 'Ajeeb, and his elegance of form
and perfect beauty, and observed him to be endowed with admirable
loveliness, and with kindness of manner, more bland than the northern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
zephyr, sweeter than limpid water to the thirsty, and more pleasant
than health to the diseased, they followed him, running after him in
crowds; and some sat waiting in the streets to see him pass. Thus
did they until the slave, as destiny had ordained, stopped before the
shop of 'Ajeeb's father, &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, in which the cook who
had acknowledged him as his adopted son in the presence of the
&#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ees and witnesses had established him; and this cook had died,
and left him all his property, together with his shop.<a href="#IV57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>When the slave stopped there on this day, the servants also stopped
with him: and &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen beheld his son, and was charmed
with him, observing his extreme beauty: his soul yearned towards him
with natural sympathy, and his heart clung to him. He had just
prepared a conserve of pomegranate-grains, sweetened with sugar;
and the affection divinely inspired increased in him; so he called out
in ecstasy, and said, O my master, O thou who hast captivated my
heart and soul, and to whom my affections are drawn by sympathy!
wilt thou come in to me and refresh my heart and eat of my food?
And when he had said this, his eyes overflowed with involuntary tears,
and he reflected upon his past experience and his condition at the
present time. When 'Ajeeb heard the address of his father, his heart
was in like manner drawn towards him by sympathy, and he looked
towards the eunuch, and said to him, Verily my heart is moved with
sympathy for this cook: he seemeth to have parted with a son: come
in with us, therefore, that we may refresh his heart and eat his offering
of hospitality: perhaps God, through our so doing, may accomplish
our union with our father. But the eunuch replied, By Allah, O my
master, it is not proper. How should we, who are of the family of
the Wezeer, eat in the shop of a cook? I will, however, drive away
the people from thee, lest they see thee: otherwise it will be impossible
for thee to enter the shop. On hearing the reply of the eunuch, Bedr-ed-Deen
was surprised, and, looking towards him, while his tears
flowed down his cheeks, said to him, Verily my heart loveth him.&mdash;Let
us hear no more of these words, said the eunuch:&mdash;and he desired
the youth not to enter: but the father of 'Ajeeb cast his eyes upon the
eunuch, and said, Great sir, wherefore wilt thou not refresh my heart
and come in to me? O thou who resemblest black dust, but whose
heart is white! O thou who hast been described in such and such
terms of praise!&mdash;so that the eunuch laughed, and said, What wouldst
thou say? Speak, and be brief.&mdash;And Bedr-ed-Deen recited this
couplet:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Were it not for his accomplishments and admirable faithfulness, he had not been invested with authority in the abode of Kings.</span>
<span class="i0">What an excellent guardian for the &#7717;areem is he! On account of his beauty the angels of heaven wait upon him!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This address pleased the eunuch so much that he took the hand of
'Ajeeb, and entered the cook's shop; and Bedr-ed-Deen ladled out a
saucerful of conserve of pomegranate-grains prepared with almonds
and sugar, and the slave and the youth ate together; Bedr-ed-Deen
saying to them, Ye have delighted me by your company: eat, and
may it benefit you! 'Ajeeb then said to his father, Sit down and eat
with us; and perhaps God will unite us to him whom we desire. And
Bedr-ed-Deen said, O my son, hast thou been afflicted in thy tender
years by the separation of those whom thou lovest?&mdash;Yes, O uncle,
answered 'Ajeeb: my heart is inflamed by the absence of one of those
who are dear to me: the friend who hath withdrawn himself from me
is my father, and I and my grandfather have come abroad to search
for him through the world; and how do I sigh for my union with
him!&mdash;And he wept bitterly; and his father, moved by his tears, wept
with him, reflecting upon his own desolate state, separated from those
he loved, deprived of his father, and far removed from his mother;
and the eunuch was moved with compassion for him.</p>

<p>They all ate together until they were satisfied; after which, the
youth and the slave arose, and quitted the shop of Bedr-ed-Deen, who
felt as if his soul had departed from his body and gone with them.
He could not endure their absence for the twinkling of an eye; so he
shut up his shop and followed them, though ignorant that the youth
was his son, and walked quickly until he came up to them before they
had gone out from the great gate; whereupon the eunuch, looking
back at him, said, What dost thou want, O cook? Bedr-ed-Deen
answered, When ye departed from me, I felt as if my soul had quitted
my body, and, having some business in the suburb, I was desirous of
accompanying you to transact my business, and, after that, to return.
But the eunuch was angry, and said to 'Ajeeb, Verily this repast was
unlucky: respectful treatment hath become incumbent on us; and
see, he is following us from place to place. 'Ajeeb therefore looked
round, and, seeing the cook, was enraged, and his face became red;
but he said to the eunuch, Suffer him to walk in the public road of
the Muslims; but when we shall have turned from it to our tents, if
he do the same, and we know that he is following us, we will drive
him back. And he hung down his head and went on, with the eunuch
behind him. Bedr-ed-Deen, however, followed them to the Meyd&aacute;n
el-&#7716;a&#7779;b&agrave;, and when they had drawn near to the tents they looked
back and saw him behind them; and 'Ajeeb was angry, fearing that
the eunuch might inform his grandfather, and lest it should be said
that he had entered the cook's shop, and that the cook had followed
him. He looked at him till his eyes met the eye of his father, who
had become as a body without a soul; and he fancied that his eye
bore an expression of deceit, and that he was perhaps a knave: so his
anger increased, and he took up a stone, and threw it at his father,
and the stone struck him on the forehead, and wounded him, and he
fell down in a swoon, the blood flowing over his face. 'Ajeeb went
on with the eunuch to the tents; and &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, when he
recovered his senses, wiped off the blood, and, having cut off a piece
of linen from his turban, bound up his head with it, blaming himself,
and saying, I wronged the youth when I shut up my shop and followed
him, so he thought I was a deceiver. He then returned to his shop,
and occupied himself with the sale of his meats; and he yearned with
desire for his mother, who was at El-Ba&#7779;rah.</p>

<p>The Wezeer, his uncle, remained at Damascus three days, and then
departed to &#7716;em&#7779;, and, having entered this town, proceeded thence,
inquiring at every place where he halted in his journey until he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
arrived at M&aacute;rideen and El-M&oacute;sil and Diy&aacute;r Bekr. He continued
his journey until he arrived at the city of El-Ba&#7779;rah, and when he had
entered it and taken up his quarters, he went and presented himself
before the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, who received him with respect and honour, and
inquired the reason of his coming: so he acquainted him with his
story, and informed him that the Wezeer 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen was his
brother. The Sul&#7789;&aacute;n ejaculated, God have mercy upon him!<a href="#IV58" class="fnanchor">58</a>&mdash;and
said, O &#7778;&aacute;&#7717;eb,<a href="#IV59" class="fnanchor">59</a> he was my Wezeer, and I loved him much: he died
twelve years<a href="#IV60" class="fnanchor">60</a> ago, and left a son; but we have lost him, and have
heard no tidings of him: his mother, however, is with us, for she is
the daughter of my old Wezeer. On hearing from the King that the
mother of his nephew was alive, the Wezeer Shems-ed-Deen rejoiced,
and said, I am desirous of having an interview with her. And the
King gave him immediate permission to visit her at his brother's
house: so he went thither, and kissed the threshold, and, entering an
open court, found a door over-arched with hard stone inlaid with
various kinds of marble of every colour; and he walked along by the
walls of the house, and as he cast his eyes around upon them he observed
the name of his brother Noor-ed-Deen inscribed on them in characters
of gold; and he went to the name, and kissed it, and wept. He then
advanced to the saloon of his brother's wife, the mother of &#7716;asan
Bedr-ed-Deen of El-Ba&#7779;rah. During the absence of her son she had
given herself up to weeping and wailing night and day; and after she
had long suffered from his separation she made for her son a tomb of
marble in the midst of the saloon, where she wept for him night and
day, sleeping nowhere but by this tomb. And when Shems-ed-Deen
arrived at her apartment he heard her voice apostrophizing the tomb;
and while she was thus occupied he entered and saluted her, and
informed her that he was her husband's brother, acquainting her with
what had passed, and revealing to her the particulars of the story.
He told her that her son &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen had passed a whole
night with his daughter, and disappeared in the morning, and that his
daughter had borne him a son, whom he had brought with him: and
when she heard this news of her son, and that he was perhaps still
living, and beheld her husband's brother, she fell at his feet and kissed
them, addressing him with this couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Divinely is he inspired who acquainteth me with their approach; for he hath brought information most delightful to be heard.</span>
<span class="i0">If he would be satisfied with that which is cast off,<a href="#IV61" class="fnanchor">61</a> I would give him a heart rent in pieces at the hour of valediction.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Wezeer then sent to bring 'Ajeeb; and when he came, his grandmother
rose to him, and embraced him, and wept; but Shems-ed-Deen
said to her, This is not a time for weeping, but rather a time for
preparing thyself to accompany us on our return to the land of Egypt:
and perhaps God may unite us with thy son, my nephew. She
replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and, arising immediately, collected all her
property and treasures, and her female slaves, and forthwith prepared
herself: after which the Wezeer, Shems-ed-Deen, went up again to
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of El-Ba&#7779;rah, and took leave of him; and the King sent
with him presents and rarities for the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of Egypt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 572px; position: relative;"><a name="f105" id="f105"></a><img src="images/fig105.png" width="572" height="429" alt="The Widow of Noor-ed-Deen kissing the feet of his Brother" title="The Widow of Noor-ed-Deen kissing the feet of his Brother" /></div>

<p>The Wezeer departed without delay, accompanied by his brother's
wife, and continued his journey until he arrived at the city of
Damascus, where he alighted again, and encamped, and said to his
attendants, We will remain at Damascus a week, to buy, for the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n,
presents and rarities. 'Ajeeb then said to the eunuch, Boy,<a href="#IV62" class="fnanchor">62</a> I long
for a little diversion: arise, therefore, and let us go to the market of
Damascus, and see what is going on there, and what hath happened
to that cook whose confection we ate and whose head we broke, notwithstanding
he had treated us with kindness: we acted ill towards
him. The eunuch replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and 'Ajeeb went forth
with him from the tents, the tie of blood inciting him to visit his
father and they entered the city, and proceeded to the shop of the
cook, whom they found standing there. It was then near the time of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
afternoon-prayers; and it happened that he had again just prepared a
confection of pomegranate-grains; and when they drew near to him,
the heart of 'Ajeeb yearned towards him when he saw him, and he
perceived the scar occasioned by the stone that he had thrown. He
said to him, Peace be on thee! Know that my heart is with thee.&mdash;And
when Bedr-ed-Deen beheld him, his affections were engrossed by
him, and his heart throbbed with emotion towards him, and he hung
down his head, desiring to adapt his tongue to speech, and unable to
do so: but presently he raised his head, and, looking towards the youth
in an humble and abject manner, recited these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wished for my beloved; but when I beheld him I was confounded and  possessed neither tongue nor eye.</span>
<span class="i0">I hung down my head in honour and reverence, and would have hidden what I felt; but it would not be concealed.</span>
<span class="i0">I had prepared a volume of expostulation; but when we met I remembered not a word.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then said to them, Refresh ye my heart, and eat of my food; for,
by Allah, as soon as I beheld thee, my heart yearned towards thee,
and I had not followed thee unless I had been deprived of my reason.&mdash;By
Allah, replied 'Ajeeb, thou dost indeed love us, and we ate a
morsel with thee; but after it thou keptest close behind us and wouldst
have disgraced us: we will not eat again with thee, therefore, but on
the condition of thy swearing that thou wilt not follow us; and otherwise
we will not come to thee again henceforth; for we are staying at
this city a week, in order that my grandfather may procure presents
for the King.&mdash;I bind myself, said Bedr-ed-Deen, to do as ye desire.
So 'Ajeeb entered the shop with the eunuch, and Bedr-ed-Deen placed
before them a saucer filled with the confection of pomegranate-grains;
upon which 'Ajeeb said to him, Eat with us; and may God dispel our
affliction:&mdash;and Bedr-ed-Deen was delighted, and he ate with them;
but he turned not his eyes from the youth; for his heart and all his
faculties were captivated by him. 'Ajeeb, observing this, said to him,
Knowest thou not that I told thee thou wast a rude doter? Enough
of this: continue not to gaze at my face.&mdash;Bedr-ed-Deen, therefore,
apologized to him, and began to put morsels into the mouth of 'Ajeeb,
and then did the same to the eunuch. Afterwards he poured the
water upon their hands, and when they had washed he loosed a napkin
of silk from his waist and wiped them with it. He next sprinkled
rose-water upon them from a bottle that was in his shop, and went
out, and returned with two cups of sherbet prepared with rose-water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
infused with musk, and, placing these before them, he said, Complete
your kindness. So 'Ajeeb took a cup and drank; and Bedr-ed-Deen
handed the other to the eunuch; and both drank until their stomachs were
full, and gratified their appetites to a degree beyond their usual habit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px; position: relative;"><a name="f106" id="f106"></a><img src="images/fig106.png" width="500" height="352" alt="Bedr-ed-Deen waiting upon his Son and the Eunuch" title="Bedr-ed-Deen waiting upon his Son and the Eunuch" /></div>

<p>They then departed, and hastened back to the tents, and 'Ajeeb
went in to his grandmother, the mother of his father &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen;
and she kissed him, and said, Where hast thou been? He
answered, In the city. And she arose, and brought him a saucer of
confection of pomegranate-grains, which happened to be somewhat
deficient in sweetness; and she said to the eunuch, Sit down with thy
master. The eunuch said within himself, By Allah, we have no
appetite. He, however, seated himself, and 'Ajeeb did the same,
though satiated with what he had eaten and drunk, and dipped a
morsel of bread in the confection, and ate it; but it seemed to him
insipid, on account of his being thus cloyed, and he loathed it, and
said, What is this nasty dish?&mdash;O my child, said his grandmother,
dost thou find fault with my cookery? It was I who prepared it;
and, except thy father, &#7716;asan Bedr-ed-Deen, there is none who can
cook it as well as myself.&mdash;By Allah, O my mistress, replied 'Ajeeb,
This thy dish is not well prepared: we have just now seen in the
city a cook who had prepared a confection of pomegranate-grains, but
its odour was such as to dilate the heart, and the confection itself,
such as to excite appetite in one already satiated: as to thine, in comparison
with his, it is good for nothing.</p>

<p>His grandmother, on hearing this, fell into a violent rage, and
turning towards the eunuch, said to him, Wo to thee! Hast thou
corrupted my child? Thou hast taken him into the shops of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
cooks!&mdash;The eunuch feared, and denied, saying, We did not enter the
shop, but only passed by it:&mdash;but 'Ajeeb said, By Allah, we entered
and ate, and what we ate was better than this mess of thine. And
upon this his grandmother arose, and informed her husband's brother,
and incensed him against the eunuch. The slave was therefore
brought before the Wezeer, and he said to him, Wherefore didst thou
take my child into the cook's shop? The eunuch, fearing, said again,
We did not enter.&mdash;Nay, said 'Ajeeb, we did enter, and ate of a confection
of pomegranate-grains until we were satiated, and the cook
gave us to drink sherbet with ice and sugar. The Wezeer's anger
with the eunuch now increased, and he asked him again; but still he
denied. Then said the Wezeer, If thine assertion be true, sit down
and eat before us. The eunuch therefore advanced, and would have
eaten; but he could not; and he threw down the morsel that was in
his hand, and said, O my master, I am satiated since yesterday. And
by this the Wezeer knew that he had eaten in the shop of the cook:
so he ordered the female slaves to throw him down upon the ground,
and they did so, and he gave him a severe beating, while the slave
cried for mercy, but still saying, I am satiated since yesterday! The
Wezeer then interrupted the beating, and said to him, Declare the
truth. And at length the eunuch said, Know that we did enter the
shop of the cook while he was cooking pomegranate-grains, and he
ladled out for us some of the confection, and, by Allah, I never in my
life ate any like it, or any more detestable than this which is before us.</p>

<p>The mother of Bedr-ed-Deen, enraged at this, said, Thou shalt go
to this cook and bring us a saucerful of his confection and shew it
to thy master, that he may say which of the two is the better and
the more delicious.&mdash;Well, replied the eunuch: and immediately she
gave him a saucer, and half a piece of gold; and he went to the shop,
and said to the cook, We have laid a wager respecting thy confection
at the tent of our master; for there is a mess of pomegranate-grains
cooked by the family: give us, therefore, for this half-piece of gold,
and apply thyself to prepare it perfectly; for we have received an
excruciating beating on account of thy cookery. Laughing at these
words, Bedr-ed-Deen replied, By Allah, none excelleth in the preparation
of this confection except myself and my mother, and she is
now in a distant country. And he ladled out as much as filled the
saucer, and perfected it by the addition of some musk and rose-water.
The eunuch then hastened back with it to the family; and the mother
of &#7716;asan took it, and, tasting its delicious flavour, immediately knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
who had prepared it, and shrieked, and fell down in a swoon. The
Wezeer was amazed at the event; and they sprinkled some rose-water
upon her, and when she recovered she said, If my son be yet in the
world, no one but he cooked this confection: he is my son &#7716;asan
Bedr-ed-Deen without doubt: for none but he can prepare this, except
myself, and it was I who taught him to do it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 564px; position: relative;"><a name="f107" id="f107"></a><img src="images/fig107.png" width="564" height="406" alt="Bedr-ed-Deen bound" title="Bedr-ed-Deen bound" /></div>

<p>When the Wezeer heard these words, he rejoiced exceedingly, and
exclaimed, Oh, how I long to behold my brother's son! Will fortune,
indeed, unite us with him? But I look not for our union from any
but God, whose name be exalted!&mdash;And he instantly arose, and called
out to his male attendants, saying, Let twenty men of you go to the
shop of the cook, and demolish it, and bind his hands behind him with
his turban, and drag him hither by force, but without any injury to
his person. They replied, Well. The Wezeer then rode immediately
to the palace, and, presenting himself before the Viceroy of Damascus,
shewed him the contents of the letters which he had brought from the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n; and the Viceroy, after kissing them, put them to his head,
and said, Who is thine offender? He answered, A man who is by
trade a cook. And instantly the Viceroy ordered his Chamberlains
to repair to his shop; and they went thither; but found it demolished,
and everything that had been in it broken; for when the Wezeer went
to the palace, his servants did as he had commanded them. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
were then waiting his return from the palace; and Bedr-ed-Deen was
saying within himself, What can they have discovered in the confection,
that such an event as this should have befallen me? And when
the Wezeer returned from the Viceroy, and had received his permission
to take his offender and to depart with him, he entered the encampment,
and called for the cook. They brought him, therefore, with his
hands bound behind him with his turban; and when he saw his uncle
he wept bitterly, and said, O my master, what crime have ye found in
me? The Wezeer said to him, Art thou he who cooked the confection
of pomegranate-grains? He answered, Yes: and have ye found in it
anything that requires one's head to be struck off? This, replied the
Wezeer, is the smallest part of thy recompense.&mdash;Wilt thou not, said
Bedr-ed-Deen, acquaint me with my crime? The Wezeer answered,
Yea, immediately. And forthwith he called out to the young men,
saying, Bring the camels!</p>

<p>They then took Bedr-ed-Deen, and put him in a chest, and, having
locked him up in it, commenced their journey, and continued on their
way till the approach of night, when they halted and ate, and, taking
out Bedr-ed-Deen, fed him; after which they put him again into the
chest, and in like manner proceeded to another station. Here also
they took him out; and the Wezeer said to him, Art thou he who
cooked the confection of pomegranate grains? He answered, Yes, O
my master. And the Wezeer said, Shackle his feet. And they did
so, and restored him to the chest. They then continued their journey
to Cairo; and when they arrived at the quarter called Er-Reyd&aacute;neeyeh,<a href="#IV63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
the Wezeer commanded to take out Bedr-ed-Deen again from the
chest, and to bring a carpenter, to whom he said, Make, for this man,
a cross.<a href="#IV64" class="fnanchor">64</a>&mdash;What, said Bedr-ed-Deen, dost thou mean to do with it?
The Wezeer answered, I will crucify thee upon it, and nail thee to it,
and then parade thee about the city.&mdash;Wherefore, demanded Bedr-ed-Deen,
wilt thou treat me thus?&mdash;The Wezeer replied, For thy faulty
preparation of the confection of pomegranate-grains, because thou
madest it deficient in pepper.&mdash;Because of its deficiency in pepper,
exclaimed Bedr-ed-Deen, wilt thou do all this to me? Art thou not
satisfied with having thus imprisoned me, and fed me every day with
only one meal?&mdash;The Wezeer answered, For its deficiency in pepper,
thy recompense shall be nothing less than death. And Bedr-ed-Deen
was amazed, and bewailed his lot, and remained a while absorbed in
reflection. The Wezeer, therefore, said to him, Of what art thou
thinking? He answered, Of imbecile minds, such as thine; for if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
thou wert a man of sense thou wouldst not have treated me in this
manner on account of the deficiency of pepper.&mdash;It is incumbent on
us, replied the Wezeer, to punish thee, that thou mayest not do the
like again:&mdash;to which Bedr-ed-Deen rejoined, The least of the things
thou hast done to me were a sufficient punishment. The Wezeer,
however, said, Thy death is unavoidable.&mdash;All this conversation took
place while the carpenter was preparing the cross; and Bedr-ed-Deen
was looking on.</p>

<p>Thus they both continued until the approach of night, when Bedr-ed-Deen's
uncle took him and put him again into the chest, saying,
To-morrow shall be thy crucifixion. He then waited until he perceived
that he was asleep; upon which he remounted, and, with the chest
borne before him, entered the city, and repaired to his house: and
when he had arrived there he said to his daughter Sitt-el-&#7716;osn, Praise
be to God who hath restored to thee the son of thine uncle! Arise,
and furnish the house as it was on the night of the bridal display.&mdash;She
therefore ordered her female slaves to do so; and they arose, and
lighted the candles; and the Wezeer brought out the paper upon
which he had written his inventory of the furniture of the house, and
read it, and ordered them to put every thing in its place, so that the
beholder would not doubt that this was the very night of the bridal
display. He directed them to put Bedr-ed-Deen's turban in the place
where its owner had deposited it, and in like manner the trousers, and
the purse which was beneath the mattress, and ordered his daughter
to adorn herself as she was on the bridal night, and to enter the bride-chamber;
saying to her, When the son of thine uncle comes into thy
chamber, say to him, Thou hast loitered since thou withdrewest from
me this night:&mdash;and request him to return and converse with thee till
day.&mdash;Having thus arranged everything, the Wezeer took out Bedr-ed-Deen
from the chest, removed the shackles from his feet, and stripped
him of his outer clothes, leaving him in his shirt.</p>

<p>All this was done while he was asleep, unconscious of what was
passing; and when he awoke, and found himself in an illuminated
vestibule, he said, within himself, Am I bewildered by dreams, or am I
awake? Then rising, he advanced a little way to an inner door, and
looked, and lo, he was in the house in which the bride had been displayed,
and he beheld the bride-chamber and the couch and his turban
and clothes. Confounded at the sight of these things, he took one
step forwards and another backwards, thinking, Am I asleep or awake?
And he began to wipe his forehead, and exclaimed in his astonishment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 429px; position: relative;"><a name="f108" id="f108"></a><img src="images/fig108.png" width="429" height="437" alt="Bedr-ed-Deen's perplexity" title="Bedr-ed-Deen's perplexity" /></div>

<p>By Allah, this is the dwelling of the bride who was here displayed
before me: and yet I was just now in a chest. And while he was
addressing himself, behold Sitt-el-&#7716;osn lifted up the corner of the
musquito curtain, and said, O my master, wilt thou not come in? for
thou hast loitered since thou withdrewest from me this night. When
he heard these words he looked at her face, and laughed, and said,
Verily, these appearances are bewildering illusions of a dream! Then
entering, he sighed; and as he reflected upon what had happened to
him, he was perplexed at his situation, and his case seemed involved in
obscurity. Looking at his turban and trousers, and the purse containing
the thousand pieces of gold, he exclaimed, Allah is all-knowing!&mdash;but
it seemeth to me that I am bewildered by dreams!&mdash;And
he was confounded in the excess of his astonishment. Upon this,
therefore, Sitt-el-&#7716;osn said to him, Wherefore do I behold thee thus
astonished and perplexed? Thou wast not so in the commencement
of the night.&mdash;And he laughed, and asked her, How many years have
I been absent from thee?&mdash;Allah preserve thee! she exclaimed. The
name of Allah encompass thee!<a href="#IV65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Thou hast only withdrawn to
yonder apartment. What hath passed in thy mind?&mdash;On hearing
this he smiled, and replied, Thou hast spoken truth; but when I
withdrew from thee, sleep overcame me, and I dreamt that I was a
cook in Damascus, and that I lived there twelve years;<a href="#IV66" class="fnanchor">66</a> and I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
that a youth of the sons of the great came to me, accompanied by a
eunuch,&mdash;and he proceeded to relate what had happened to him in
consequence of this youth's visit: then drawing his hand over his
forehead, he felt the scar occasioned by the blow, and exclaimed, By
Allah, O my mistress, it seemeth as though it were true; for he struck
me with a stone upon my forehead, and cut it open: it seemeth,
therefore, as though this had really happened when I was awake:
but probably this dream occurred when we were both asleep. I
imagined in my dream that I was transported to Damascus, without
&#7789;arboosh or turban or trousers, and that I followed the occupation of
a cook.&mdash;And again, for a while, he remained utterly confounded. He
then said, By Allah, I imagined that I made a confection of pomegranate-grains
containing but little pepper. Verily I must have been
asleep, and in my sleep have seen all this.&mdash;I conjure thee by Allah,
said Sitt-el-&#7716;osn, tell me what more thou sawest? And he related
to her the whole; and added, If I had not awaked, they would have
crucified me upon a wooden cross.&mdash;On account of what? said she.
He answered, On account of the deficiency of pepper in the confection
of pomegranate-grains; and I imagined that they demolished my shop,
and broke all my vessels, and put me in a chest, and brought the
carpenter to make a cross of wood; for they intended to crucify me
upon it. Praise be to God, therefore, who caused all this to occur to
me in sleep, and caused it not to happen to me when I was awake!&mdash;Sitt-el-&#7716;osn,
laughing at his words, pressed him to her bosom, and
he in like manner embraced her. Then reflecting again, he said, By
Allah, it seems as if it had happened when I was awake; and I knew
not the reason, nor the truth of the case.&mdash;And he composed himself
to sleep, perplexed with his case, and sometimes saying, I saw it in my
sleep,&mdash;and other times, I experienced it awake.</p>

<p>Thus he continued until the morning, when his uncle, the Wezeer
Shems-ed-Deen, came in to him, and saluted him; and Bedr-ed-Deen,
as soon as he beheld him, exclaimed, I conjure thee by Allah, tell me
art not thou he who gave orders to bind my hands behind me, and to
nail up my shop, on account of the confection of pomegranate-grains,
because it was deficient in pepper? The Wezeer answered, Know, O
my son, that the truth hath appeared, and what was hidden hath been
manifested. Thou art the son of my brother; and I did not this but
to know if thou wert he who visited my daughter on that night. I
was not convinced of this until I saw that thou knewest the house,
and thy turban and trousers and gold, and the two papers; namely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
the one which thou wrotest, and that which thy father, my brother,
wrote: for I had never seen thee before, and therefore knew thee not;
and as to thy mother, I have brought her with me from El-Ba&#7779;rah.&mdash;Having
thus said, he threw himself upon him, and wept; and Bedr-ed-Deen,
full of astonishment at his uncle's words, embraced him, and
in like manner wept from excess of joy. The Wezeer then said to
him, O my son, the cause of all this was what passed between me and
thy father. And he related to him the circumstances of their case,
and the cause of his father's departure to El-Ba&#7779;rah; after which he
sent for 'Ajeeb; and when the father of the youth saw him, he exclaimed,
This is he who threw the stone at me.&mdash;This, said the Wezeer, is thy
son. And Bedr-ed-Deen cast himself upon him, and recited the
following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long have I wept on account of our disunion; the tears overflowing from my eyelids;</span>
<span class="i0">And I vowed that if Providence should bring us together, I would never again mention our separation.</span>
<span class="i0">Joy hath overcome me to such a degree that by its excess it hath made me weep.</span>
<span class="i0">O eye, thou hast become so accustomed to tears that thou weepest from happiness as from grief.<a href="#IV67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when he had uttered these words, his mother, beholding him,
threw herself upon him, and repeated this couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fortune made a vow to torment me incessantly; but thine oath hath proved false, O Fortune; therefore expiate it.<a href="#IV68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span>
<span class="i0">Happiness hath arrived, and the beloved is come to my relief: repair then to the messenger of festivity, and hasten.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>She afterwards related to him everything that had happened to her;
and he also acquainted her with all that he had suffered; and they
offered up thanks to God for their union. The Wezeer then went up
to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and informed him of these occurrences; and the King
was astonished, and ordered that a statement of them should be
inserted in the records, to be preserved to future ages. And the
Wezeer resided with his brother's son, and his own daughter and her
son, and with the wife of his brother; and all of them passed their
lives in the enjoyment of the utmost happiness until they were visited
by the terminator of delights, and the separator of companions.<a href="#IV69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>Such, O Prince of the Faithful, said Ja&#7841;far, were the events that
happened to the Wezeer Shems-ed-Deen and his brother Noor-ed-Deen.&mdash;By
Allah, exclaimed the Khaleefeh H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed, this story
is wonderful! And he gave one of his own concubines to the young
man who had killed his wife, and appointed him a regular maintenance;
and the young man became one of his companions at the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<h5>NOTES TO CHAPTER FOURTH.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV1" id="IV1">1.</a></span> From the close of Chapter iii., the order of the tales in this translation
(agreeably with the Cairo edition) differs from that which is followed in the old
version.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV2" id="IV2">2.</a></span> This alludes to the poor man's want of sufficient clothing; for, in the
climate of Baghd&aacute;d, a person who is not very scantily clad is in little need of a fire to
warm himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV3" id="IV3">3.</a></span> My sheykh has remarked, in a marginal note, that these verses would be
appropriate only from the mouth of a learned man complaining of the unprofitableness
of his science with respect to procuring him money; but perhaps, in writing this, he
was actuated by a somewhat over-zealous regard for the honour of his own profession;
for, when a poor man has acquired a little knowledge, his neighbours are apt to flatter
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV4" id="IV4">4.</a></span> The "iz&aacute;r" has been described in the second note to Chapter iii.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV5" id="IV5">5.</a></span> Literally, "the sons of thine uncle;" but the meaning is, "thy
kinsmen."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV6" id="IV6">6.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Bastinading.</i> In Arabian, and some other Eastern, countries, it is a
common custom, when a person is accused of a crime before a magistrate, and denies
his guilt, to bastinade him, in order to induce him to confess; and even witnesses,
sometimes, are treated in the same manner. The beating is usually inflicted with a
kurb&aacute;j (a thong or whip of hippopotamus' hide hammered into a round form) or with a
stick, and generally on the soles of the feet. For this purpose the feet are confined by
a chain or rope attached at each end to a staff, which is turned round to tighten it.
This is called a "fala&#7731;ah." Two persons (one on each side) strike alternately; and
the punishment is often continued until the sufferer becomes insensible, and even
longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV7" id="IV7">7.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Of Sales by Auction.</i> In many of the soo&#7731;s (market-streets, or b&aacute;z&aacute;rs) in
Arabian cities, auctions are held on stated days, once or more frequently in every week.
They are conducted by brokers (dell&aacute;ls), hired either by private persons or by shopkeepers.
These brokers carry the goods up and down the street, announcing the sums
bidden, with cries of "&#7717;ar&aacute;j," &amp;c.; and the shopkeepers, as well as others, purchase of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV8" id="IV8">8.</a></span> I have before mentioned, that this horrid mode of punishing a woman
suspected of incontinence is not unfrequently practised among the Arabs. Many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
similar cases have been mentioned to me in Egypt as having occurred in that country
in the present age; and often the murder is committed by the father or a brother of
the woman, as her relations are considered as more disgraced than the husband by her
crime. The present tale is probably founded on some particular occurrence of this
kind. One is related as having happened in the reign of the Khaleefeh El-Mo&#7841;ta&#7693;id.
In this case, some limbs of the murdered woman, in two leathern bags, were brought
up from the bed of the Tigris in the net of a fisherman.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> [Such barbarity, however, is
contrary to law, as is stated in two former notes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV9" id="IV9">9.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Of the Retaliation of Injuries on the Day of Resurrection.</i> The "examination
being past, and every one's works weighed in a just balance, that mutual retaliation
will follow according to which every creature will take vengeance one of another, or
have satisfaction made to him for the injuries which he hath suffered. And since there
will then be no other way of returning like for like, the manner of giving this satisfaction
will be, by taking away a proportionable part of the good works of him who offered the
injury, and adding it to those of him who suffered it. Which being done, if the angels (by
whose ministry this is to be performed) say, 'Lord, we have given to every one his due,
and there remaineth of this person's good works so much as equalleth the weight of an
ant,' God will of his mercy cause it to be doubled unto him, that he may be admitted
into Paradise; but if, on the contrary, his good works be exhausted, and there remain
evil works only, and there be any who have not yet received satisfaction from him, God
will order that an equal weight of their sins be added unto his, that he may be punished
for them in their stead, and he will be sent to Hell laden with both."<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV10" id="IV10">10.</a></span> "Rey&#7717;&aacute;n" is a common proper name of men, now commonly given to
slaves; and the name of the sweet basil in particular (also called "ree&#7717;&aacute;n") and of
sweet-smelling plants in general. It also signifies "any favour of God," "the supplies
necessary for subsistence," "a son," &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV11" id="IV11">11.</a></span> This ejaculation is addressed to God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV12" id="IV12">12.</a></span> In the original, "Mi&#7779;r," <i>vulg.</i>, "Ma&#7779;r." This is the name which the
Arabs give to Egypt, and which they have also given to its successive capitals, or seats
of government, Memphis, Egyptian Babylon, El-Fus&#7789;&aacute;&#7789;, and El-&#7730;&aacute;hireh, or Cairo. It
is here applied to Cairo, as will be shewn by the following note, and by the sequel of
the tale, though this city was not founded until long after the reign of H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed.
I may here remark, that I have not found the name of "Mi&#7779;r" applied to
Cairo in any Arabic work anterior to the conquest of Egypt by the 'Osm&aacute;nlee Turks,
which happened in the year of the Flight 923 (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1517). El-Fus&#7789;&aacute;&#7789; retained this
appellation in the time of Es-Suyoo&#7789;ee, who died in the year of the Flight 911, but it
ceased to do so before the time of El-Is-&#7717;&aacute;&#7731;ee, who brought down his history to the
month of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, 1032 (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1623). It is probable, therefore, that the name of
"Misr"[typo Mi&#7779;r] was transferred to Cairo on the occasion of the conquest by the Turks. I
must not assert, that this observation alone enables us to form a decided judgment as
to the period when this work was composed, as it may be objected that copyists have
perhaps substituted "Mi&#7779;r" for "El-&#7730;&aacute;hireh;" but I persue the inquiry in the next
note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV13" id="IV13">13.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On several Evidences of the Period when this Work, in the states in which it
is known to us, was composed or compiled or remodelled.</i> The tale here presents another
anachronism. The title of "Sul&#7789;&aacute;n," as a prefix, was first borne by Ma&#7717;mood Ibn-Sabuktekeen,
in the year of the Flight 393, just two hundred years after the death of
H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed; and there was no Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of Egypt until the year of the Flight
567 of a little later; the first being the famous &#7778;al&aacute;&#7717;-ed-Deen, or Saladin.</p>

<p>I have now given several data upon which to found a reasonable opinion as to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>age when these tales, in the states in which they are known to us, were composed or
compiled or remodelled. First, in Note 55 to Chapter ii., I have shewn that a fiction
in one of the tales is framed in accordance with the distinction of Muslims, Christians,
and Jews, by the colours of their turbans, which mode of distinction originated in the
beginning of the eighth century of the Flight. Secondly, in the present note, I have
mentioned a fact which affords some reason for inferring that there had been a long
series of Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns in Egypt before the age of the writer or writers. In the third place,
I must remark, that all the events described in this work are said to have happened in
ages which, with respect to that of the writer or writers, were <i>ancient</i>, being related to
an ancient king; from which I think we may infer its age to have been at least two
centuries posterior to the period mentioned in the first of these data. Fourthly, in
Note 22 to Chapter iii., I have shewn that the state of manners and morals described
in many of these tales agrees, in a most important point of view, with the manners and
morals of the Arabs at the commencement of the tenth century of the Flight. This I
regard as an argument of great weight, and especially satisfactory as agreeing with the
inference just before drawn. Fifthly, from what I have stated in the note immediately
preceding, I incline to the opinion that few of the copies of this work now known to us,
if any, were written until after the conquest of Egypt by the Turks, in the year 1517 of
our era. This opinion, it should be remarked, respects especially the <i>early</i> portion of the
work, which is the least likely to have been interpolated, as later parts evidently have been.
At the last-mentioned period, a native of Cairo (in which city I believe the principal
portion of the work to have been written) might, if about forty years of age, retain a
sufficient recollection of the later Memlook Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns and of their ministers to describe
his kings and courts without the necessity of consulting the writings of historians; deriving
his knowledge of early times not from the perusal of any regular record, but
only from traditions or from works like the present.&mdash;I should have delayed the insertion
of the foregoing remarks, had I not considered it a point of some importance to
suggest to the reader, as early as possible, that the manners and customs, and in
general even the dresses and dwellings, described in most of the present tales, are those
of a very late period. The lax state of morals which appears to have prevailed among
the Arabs in the time of the writer or writers probably continued at least until the
period when coffee became a common beverage, about the middle of the tenth century
of the Flight (or near the middle of the sixteenth century of our era), and perhaps considerably
later, until some years after the introduction of tobacco into the East. The
researches of Von Hammer have satisfactorily shewn that the Thousand and One Nights,
in the states in which it is known to us, is based upon a very old work, in Persian; an
Arabic translation of which bore a similar, or perhaps the same, title as that which
we are considering; but I believe the last to be, in its best features, a very late production.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV14" id="IV14">14.</a></span> "Shems-ed-Deen" signifies "the Sun of the Religion;" and "Noor-ed-Deen,"
"the Light of the Religion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV15" id="IV15">15.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Customs observed after a Death.</i> Though the men, in Arabian countries,
make no change in their dress in indication of mourning, they observe other customs
after the death of a relation. By the term here used in the original for "mourning"
("'az&aacute;," the primary signification of which is "consolation" or "condolence"), an
allusion is made to receiving the visits of condoling friends. On the night immediately
following the burial, several persons are employed to perform recitations of portions of
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, &amp;c. The most remarkable of these ceremonies consists in repeating thrice
one thousand times, "There is no deity but God:" one of the performers having a
string of a thousand large beads by means of which to count these repetitions. Some
persons are also hired to perform a recitation of the whole of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n in the afternoon
or evening of the first Thursday after the funeral, and often on other days; and
the merit of these and the former religious acts is transferred to the soul of the de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>ceased.&mdash;These
customs I have fully described in my work on the Modern Egyptians,
vol. ii. ch. xv.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV16" id="IV16">16.</a></span> The island here alluded to is that called "Er-R&oacute;&#7693;ah," or "The
Garden."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV17" id="IV17">17.</a></span> The prayer-carpet, which resembles a wide hearth-rug, is seldom used
as a covering for the saddle except when the rider is a person of the learned profession.
It is probably mentioned here to shew that Noor-ed-Deen was an officer of the pen,
which was generally the case with the Wezeers of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns of Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV18" id="IV18">18.</a></span> Jerusalem is called in the original, and by the modern Arabs, "El-&#7730;uds,"
which signifies "Holiness."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV19" id="IV19">19.</a></span> The Arabic name of Aleppo is "&#7716;alab."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV20" id="IV20">20.</a></span> An Arab of rank is seldom seen on foot outside the threshold of his own
house, unless it be merely to cross the street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV21" id="IV21">21.</a></span> The decoration here alluded to consists in furnishing the apartment
with costly carpets, handsome cushions, rich coverings for the deew&aacute;ns, and coloured
lamps, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV22" id="IV22">22.</a></span> This, to some readers, may appear odd: it should therefore be explained
that most articles of Arab clothing are equally suitable to young and old, thin
and stout.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV23" id="IV23">23.</a></span> "&#7716;asan" signifies "Beautiful" or "Handsome."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV24" id="IV24">24.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Infancy and Education.</i> I may avoid an unnecessary multiplication
of notes on the same, or nearly the same, subject, by availing myself of this occasion to
insert here the following illustrations of numerous passages, in the preceding and subsequent
tales, relating to infancy and education.</p>

<p>In few cases are the Mohammadans so much fettered by the directions of their
Prophet and other religious institutors as in the rearing and educating of their
children. In matters of the most trivial nature, religious precedents direct their management
of the young. One of the first duties is, to wrap the new-born child in clean
white linen, or in linen of some other colour; but not yellow. After this, some person
[not a female] should pronounce the ad&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> in the ear of the infant, because the
Prophet did so in the ear of El-&#7716;asan when F&aacute;timeh gave birth to him; or he should
pronounce the ad&aacute;n in the right ear, and the i&#7731;ameh (which is nearly the same) in the
left.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<p>It was formerly a custom of many of the Arabs, and perhaps is still among some, for
the father to give a feast to his friends on seven successive days after the birth of a
son; but that of a daughter was observed with less rejoicing. The general modern
custom is, to give an entertainment only on the seventh day, which is called "Y&oacute;m
es-Suboo&#7841;." On this occasion, the mother, having left her bed, receives her guests;
the child is exhibited to them; and they give presents of gold or silver coins, which
are generally used to decorate the infant's head-dress. The father entertains his friends
in the evening.</p>

<p>On this day, or on the fourteenth, twenty-first, twenty-eighth, or thirty-fifth day
after the birth, several religious ceremonies are required to be performed; but they are
most approved if observed on the seventh day. One of these is the naming. I
believe, however, that it is a more common custom to give the name almost immediately
after the birth, or about three hours after. Astrologers were often consulted on this
occasion; but the following directions are given on higher authority, and are generally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>observed.&mdash;"The father should give his son a good name, ... not a name of self-praise,
as Rasheed [Orthodox], Emeen [Faithful], &amp;c.... The prophet said, 'The
names most approved by God are 'Abd-Allah [Servant of God] and 'Abd-Er-Ra&#7717;m&aacute;n
[Servant of the Compassionate], and such like.' He also said, 'Give my name, but do
not distinguish by my surname of relationship:' but this precept, they say, respects his
own life-time, ... because he was addressed, 'O Abu-l-&#7730;&aacute;sim!' and now it is not disapproved;
but some disapprove of uniting the name and surname, so as to call a person
Mohammad and Abu-l-&#7730;&aacute;sim. And if a son be called by the name of a prophet it is
not allowable to abuse or vilify him, unless the person so named be facing his reproacher,
who should say, 'Thou' [without mentioning his name]: and a child named
Mo&#7717;ammad or A&#7717;mad should be [especially] honoured.... The Prophet said,
'There is no people holding a consultation at which there is present one whose name is
Mo&#7717;ammad or A&#7717;mad, but God blesseth all that assembly:' and again he said,
'Whoever nameth his child by my name, or by that of any of my children or my companions,
from affection to me or to them, God (whose name be exalted!) will give him in
Paradise what eye hath not seen nor ear heard.' And a son should not be named King
of kings, or Lord of lords; nor should a man take a surname of relationship from the
name of the eldest of his children; nor take any such surname before a child is born to
him."<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a>&mdash;The custom of naming children after prophets, or after relations or companions
of Mo&#7717;ammad, is very common. No ceremony is observed on account of the
naming.</p>

<p>On the same day, however, two practices which I am about to mention are prescribed
to be observed; though, as far as my observations and inquiries allow me to
judge, they are generally neglected by the modern Muslims. The first of these is a
sacrifice. The victim is called 'a&#7731;ee&#7731;ah. It should be a ram or goat; or two such
animals should be sacrificed for a son, and one for a daughter. This rite is regarded
by Ibn-&#7716;ambal as absolutely obligatory: he said, "If a father sacrifice not for his son,
and he [the son] die, that son will not intercede for him on the day of judgment."
The founders of the three other principal sects regard it in different and less important
lights, though Mohammad slew an 'a&#7731;ee&#7731;ah for himself after his prophetic mission.
The person should say, on slaying the victim, "O God, verily this a&#7731;ee[.]kah is a ransom
for my son such a one; its blood for his blood, and its flesh for his flesh, and its bone for
his bone, and its skin for his skin, and its hair for his hair. O God, make it a ransom
for my son from Hell-fire." A bone of the victim should not be broken.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> The midwife
should receive a leg of it. It should be cooked without previously cutting off any
portion of it; and part of it should be given in alms.&mdash;After this should be performed
the other ceremony above alluded to, which is this. It is a sunneh ordinance, incumbent
on the father, to shave, or cause to be shaved, the head of his child, and to
give, in alms to the poor, the weight of the hair in gold or silver. This should also be
done for a proselyte.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> On the subsequent occasions of shaving the head of a male
child (for the head of the male is frequently shaven), a tuft of hair is generally left on
the crown, and commonly, for several years, another also over the forehead.</p>

<p>Circumcision is most approved if performed on the same day:<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> but the observance
of this rite is generally delayed until the child has attained the age of five or six years,
and sometimes several years later. I shall therefore delay mentioning the ceremonies
with which it is celebrated.</p>

<p>The Muslims rightly regard a child as a trust committed by God to its parents, who,
they hold, are responsible for the manner in which they bring it up, and will be examined
on this subject on the day of judgment. But they further venture to say, that
"the first who will lay hold of a man on the day of judgment will be his wife and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>children, who [if he have been deficient in his duty to them] will present themselves
before God, and say, 'O our Lord, take for us our due from him; for he taught us not
that of which we were ignorant, and he fed us with forbidden food, and we knew not:'
and their due will be taken from him."<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> By this is meant, that a certain proportion of
the good works which the man may have done, and his children and wife neglected,
will be set down to their account; or that a similar proportion of their evil works will
be transferred to <i>his</i> account.</p>

<p>The mother is enjoined by the law to give suck to her child two full years, unless
she have her husband's consent to shorten the period, or to employ another nurse.
"For suckling the child, a virtuous woman, who eateth only what is lawful, should be
chosen; for the unlawful [food] will manifest its evil in the child: as the Prophet ... said,
'Giving suck altereth the tempers.' But it is recommended by the sunneh that
the mother herself suckle the child; for it is said in a tradition, 'There is nothing better
for a child than its mother's milk.' 'If thou wouldst try,' it is added,'whether a child
be of an ingenuous disposition in its infancy, or not, order a woman who is not its
mother to suckle it after its mother has done so; and if it drink of the milk of the
woman who is not its mother, it is not of an ingenuous disposition.'"<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>Children, being regarded by Muslim parents as enviable blessings, are, to them,
objects of the most anxious solicitude. To guard them from the supposed influence of
the envious or evil eye, they have recourse to various expedients. When they are taken
abroad, they are usually clad in the most slovenly manner, and left unwashed, or even
purposely smeared with dirt; and as a further precaution, a fantastic cap is often put
upon the child's head, or its head-dress is decorated with one or more coins, a feather,
a gay tassel, or a written charm or two sewed up in leather or encased in gold or silver,
or some other appendage to attract the eye, that so the infant itself may pass unnoticed.
If a person express his admiration of another's child otherwise than by some
pious ejaculation, as, for instance, by praising its Creator (with the exclamation of
"Sub&#7717;&aacute;na-ll&aacute;h!" or, "M&aacute; sh&aacute;a-ll&aacute;h!" &amp;c.) or invoking a blessing on the Prophet, he fills
the mind of the parent with apprehension; and recourse is had to some superstitious
ceremony to counteract the dreaded influence of his envious glance. The children of
the poor are less exposed to this imaginary danger from their unattractive appearance:
they generally have little clothing, or none whatever, and are extremely dirty. It is
partly with the view of protecting them from the evil eye, that those of the rich are so
long confined to the &#7717;areem: there they are petted and pampered for several years; at
least until they are of age to go to school; but most of them are instructed at home.</p>

<p>The children of the Muslims are taught to shew to their fathers a degree of respect
which might be deemed incompatible with the existence of a tender mutual affection;
but I believe that this is not the case. The child greets the father in the morning by
kissing his hand, and then usually stands before him in a respectful attitude, with the
left hand covered by the right, to receive any order or to await his permission to
depart; but after the respectful kiss, is often taken on the lap. After the period of
infancy, the well-bred son seldom sits in the presence of his father; but during that
period he is generally allowed much familiarity. A Syrian merchant, who was one of
my near neighbours in Cairo, had a child of exquisite beauty, commonly supposed to be
his daughter, whom, though he was a most bigoted Muslim, he daily took with him
from his private house to his shop. The child followed him, seated upon an ass, before
a black slave; and, until about six years old, was dressed like most young ladies, but
without a face-veil. The father then thinking that the appearance of taking about
with him a daughter of that age was scandalous, dressed his pet as a boy, and told his
friends that the female attire had been employed as a protection against the evil eye;
girls being less coveted than boys. This indeed is sometimes done; and it is possible
that such might have been the case in this instance; but I was led to believe that it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>was not so. A year after, I left Cairo: while I remained there, I continued to see the
child pass my house as before; but always in boy's clothing.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the natives of Arabian countries, where a very trifling
expense is required to rear the young, should be generally desirous of a numerous offspring.
A motive of self-interest conduces forcibly to cherish this feeling in a wife, for
she is commonly esteemed by her husband in proportion to her fruitfulness; and a man
is seldom willing to divorce a wife, or to sell a slave, who has borne him a child. A
similar feeling also induces in both parents a desire to obtain offspring, and renders
them at the same time resigned to the loss of such of their children as die in tender age.
This feeling arises from their belief of certain services, of greater moment than the
richest blessings this world can bestow, which children who die in infancy are to render
to their parents. The Prophet is related to have said, "The infant children [of the
Muslims] shall assemble at the scene of judgment on the day of the general resurrection,
when all creatures shall appear for the reckoning, and it will be said to the angels,
'Go ye with these into Paradise:' and they will halt at the gate of Paradise, and it will
be said to them, 'Welcome to the offspring of the Muslims! enter ye Paradise: there
is no reckoning to be made with you:' and they will reply, 'Yea, and our fathers and
our mothers:' but the guardians of Paradise will say, 'Verily your fathers and your
mothers are not with you because they have committed faults and sins for which they
must be reckoned with and inquired of.' Then they will shriek and cry at the gate of
Paradise with a great cry; and God (whose name be exalted!) and who is all-knowing
respecting them will say, 'What is this cry?' It will be answered, 'O our Lord, the
children of the Muslims say, We will not enter Paradise but with our fathers and our
mothers.' Whereupon God (whose name be exalted!) will say 'Pass among them all,
and take the hands of your parents, and introduce them into Paradise.'" The children
who are to have this power are such as are born of believers, and die without having
attained to the knowledge of sin; and according to one tradition, one such child will
introduce his parents into Paradise. [Such infants only are to enter Paradise; for, of
the children who die in infancy, those of believers alone are they who would believe if
they grew to years of discretion.] On the same authority it is said, "When a child of
the servant [of God] dies, God (whose name be exalted!) saith to the angels, 'Have ye
taken the child of my servant?' They answer, 'Yea.' He saith, 'Have ye taken the
child of his heart?' They reply, 'Yea.' He asketh them, 'What did my servant say?'
They answer, 'He praised thee, and said, Verily to God we belong, and verily unto
Him we return!' Then God will say, 'Build for my servant a house in Paradise, and
name it the House of Praise.'" To these traditions, which I find related as proofs of
the advantages of marriage, the following anecdote, which is of a similar nature, is
added. A certain man, who would not take a wife, awoke one day from his sleep, and
demanded to be married, saying, as his reason, "I dreamt that the resurrection had
taken place, and that I was among the beings collected at the scene of judgment, but
was suffering a thirst that stopped up the passage of my stomach; and lo, there were
youths passing through the assembly, having in their hands ewers of silver, and cups of
gold, and giving drink to one person after another; so I stretched forth my hand to
one of them, and said, 'Give me to drink; for thirst overpowereth me:' but they
answered, 'Thou hast no child among us: we give drink only to our fathers.' I asked
them, 'Who are ye?' They replied, 'We are the deceased infant children of the
Muslims.'"<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> Especial rewards in heaven are promised to mothers. "When a woman
conceives by her husband," said the Prophet, "she is called in heaven a martyr [<i>i.e.</i> she
is ranked as a martyr in dignity]; and her labour in child-bed, and her care for her
children, protect her from Hell-fire.'"<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>"When the child begins to speak, the father should teach him first the kelimeh [or
profession of faith], 'There is no deity but God: [Mo&#7717;ammad is God's apostle:]'&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>should dictate this to him seven times. Then he should instruct him to say, 'Wherefore,
exalted be God, the King, the Truth! There is no deity but He, the Lord of the
honourable throne."<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> He should teach him also the Throne-verse,<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> and the closing
words of the &#7716;ashr, 'He is God, beside whom there is no deity, the King, the
Holy,'" &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>As soon as a son is old enough, his father should teach him the most important
rules of decent behaviour: placing some food before him, he should order him to take
it with the right hand (the left being employed for unclean purposes), and to say, on
commencing, "In the name of God;" to eat what is next to him, and not to hurry, nor
spill any of the food upon his person or dress. He should teach him that it is disgusting
to eat much. He should particularly condemn to him the love of gold and silver,
and caution him against covetousness as he would against serpents and scorpions; and
forbid his spitting in an assembly, and committing any similar breach of good manners,
talking much, turning his back upon another, standing in an indolent attitude, and
speaking ill of any person to another. He should keep him from bad companions,
teach him the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n and all requisite divine and prophetic ordinances, and instruct
him in the arts of swimming and archery, and in some virtuous trade; for trade is a
security from poverty. He should also command him to endure patiently the chastisements
of his teacher. In one tradition it is said, "When a boy attains the age of six
years he should be disciplined; and when he attains to nine years he should be put in
a separate bed; and when he attains to ten years he should be beaten for [neglecting]
prayer:" in another tradition, "Order your children to pray at seven [years], and
beat them for [neglecting] it at ten, and put them in separate beds."<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<p>Circumcision, which has before been mentioned, is generally performed before the
boy is submitted to the instruction of the schoolmaster.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> Previously to the performance
of this rite, he is, if belonging to the higher or middle rank of society, usually paraded
about the neighbourhood of his parents' dwelling, gaily attired, chiefly with female
habits and ornaments, but with a boy's turban on his head, mounted on a horse, preceded
by musicians, and followed by a group of his female relations and friends. This
ceremony is observed by the great with much pomp and with sumptuous feasts. El-Jabartee
mentions a f&ecirc;te celebrated on the occasion of the circumcision of a son of the
&#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee of Cairo, in the year of the Flight 1179 (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1766), when the grandees and chief
merchants and 'ulam&agrave; of the city sent him such abundance of presents that the
magazines of his mansion were filled with rice and butter and honey and sugar; the
great hall, with coffee; and the middle of the court, with firewood: the public were
amused for many days by players and performers of various kinds; and when the youth
was paraded through the streets he was attended by numerous memlooks with their
richly-caparisoned horses and splendid arms and armour and military band, and by a
number of other youths who, from compliment to him, were circumcised afterwards
with him. This latter custom is usual on such occasions; and so also is the sending of
presents, such as those above mentioned, by friends, acquaintances, and tradespeople.'
At a f&ecirc;te of this kind, when the Khaleefeh El-Mu&#7731;tedir circumcised five of his sons, the
money that was scattered in presents amounted to six hundred thousand pieces of gold,
or about &pound;300,000. Many orphans were also circumcised on the same day, and were
presented with clothes and pieces of gold.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> The Khaleefeh above mentioned was
famous for his magnificence, a proof of which I have given in a former note. At the
more approved entertainments which are given in celebration of a circumcision, a
recital of the whole of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, or a zikr, is performed: at some others, male or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>female public dancers perform in the court of the house, or in the street before the
door.</p>

<p>Few of the children of the Arabs receive much instruction in literature, and still
fewer are taught even the rudiments of any of the higher sciences; but there are
numerous schools in their towns, and one at least in almost every moderately large
village. The former are mostly attached to mosques and other public buildings, and,
together with those buildings, endowed by princes or other men of rank, or wealthy
tradesmen. In these, the children are instructed either gratis or for a very trifling
weekly payment, which all parents, except those in indigent circumstances, can
easily afford. The schoolmaster generally teaches nothing more than to read, and to
recite by heart the whole of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n. After committing to memory the first chapter
of the sacred volume, the boy learns the rest in the inverse order of their arrangement, as
they generally decrease in length. Writing and arithmetic are usually taught by another
master; and grammar, rhetoric, versification, logic, the interpretation of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n,
and the whole system of religion and law, with all other knowledge deemed useful,
which seldom includes the mere elements of mathematics, are attained by studying at a
collegiate mosque, and at no expense; for the professors receive no pay either from the
students, who are mostly of the poorer classes, or from the funds of the mosque.</p>

<p>The wealthy often employ for their sons a private tutor; and, when he has taught
them to read, and to recite the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, engage for them a writing-master, and then
send them to the college. But among this class, polite literature is more considered
than any other branch of knowledge, after religion. Such an acquaintance with the
works of some of their favourite poets as enables a man to quote them occasionally in
society, is regarded by the Arabs as essential to a son who is to mix in genteel company;
and to this acquirement is often added some skill in the art of versification, which is
rendered peculiarly easy by the copiousness of the Arabic language, and by its system
of inflection. These characteristics of their noble tongue (which are remarkably exhibited
by the custom, common among the Arabs, of preserving the same rhyme throughout
a whole poem), while on the one hand they have given an admirable freedom to the
compositions of men of true poetic genius, have on the other hand mainly contributed
to the degradation of Arabic poetry. To an Arab of some little learning it is almost
as easy to speak in verse as in prose; and hence he often intersperses his prose writings,
and not unfrequently his conversation, with indifferent verses, of which the chief merit
often consists in puns, or in an ingenious use of several words nearly the same in sound,
but differing in sense. To a reader unacquainted with the Arabic language it is
necessary to explain this custom; otherwise he would imagine that the author of the
present work is merely indulging in a dramatic licence inconsistent with a true delineation
of manners, when he makes a person suddenly change the style of his speech from
prose to verse, and then revert to the former.</p>

<p>One more duty of a father to a son I should here mention: it is, to procure for him
a wife as soon as he has arrived at a proper age. This age is decided by some to be
twenty years; though many young men marry at an earlier period. It is said, "When
a son has attained the age of twenty years, his father, if able, should marry him, and
then take his hand, and say, 'I have disciplined thee, and taught thee, and married
thee: I now seek refuge with God from thy mischief in the present world and the
next.'" To enforce this duty, the following tradition is urged: "When a son attains
to the age of puberty, and his father does not marry him, and yet is able to do so, if
the youth commit an improper act in consequence, the sin of it is between the two,"&mdash;or,
as in another report,&mdash;"on the father."<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The same is held to be the case with
respect to a daughter who has attained the age of twelve years.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<p>The female children of the Arabs are seldom taught even to read. Though they are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>admissible at the daily schools in which the boys are instructed, very few parents allow
them the benefit of this privilege; preferring, if they give them any instruction of a
literary kind, to employ a sheykhah (or learned woman) to teach them at home. She
instructs them in the forms of prayer, and teaches them to repeat by heart a few
chapters of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n; very rarely the whole book. Parents are indeed recommended
to withhold from their daughters some portions of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n; to "teach them the
Soorat en-Noor [or 24th chapter], and keep from them the Soorat-Yoosuf [12th chapter];
on account of the story of Zeleekh&agrave; and Yoosuf in the latter, and the prohibitions and
threats and mention of punishments contained in the former."<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>Needlework is not so rarely, but yet not generally, taught to Arab girls: the
spindle frequently employs those of the poorer classes; and some of them learn to weave.
The daughters of persons of the middle and higher ranks are often instructed in the
art of embroidery, and in other ornamental work, which are taught in schools and in
private houses. Singing, and playing upon the lute, which were formerly not uncommon
female accomplishments among the wealthy Arabs, are now almost exclusively confined,
like dancing, to professional performers and a few of the slaves in the &#7717;areems of the
great: it is very seldom now that any musical instrument is seen in the hand of an Arab
lady, except a kind of drum called darabukkeh, and a &#7789;&aacute;r (or tambourine), which are
found in many &#7717;areems, and are beaten with the fingers.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> Some care, however, is
bestowed by the ladies in teaching their daughters what they consider an elegant gait
and carriage, as well as various alluring and voluptuous arts with which to increase the
attachment of their future husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV25" id="IV25">25.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Water-wheels.</i> The water-wheels here mentioned are machines commonly
used for the purpose of irrigating fields and gardens. They are generally turned by a
pair of cows or bulls. They raise the water from a river or well in a series of earthen
pots attached to cords which pass over a vertical wheel, and pour it into a trough, from
which it flows in narrow channels through the space of ground to be irrigated. A
cogged vertical wheel is attached to the same axis as the former; and this, and consequently
the other also, are turned by means of a larger, horizontal, cogged wheel.
The ground is divided into hollow squares, or furrows, into each of which in succession
the water is admitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV39" id="IV39">39.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Marriage.</i> Previously to the perusal of the first description of a
nuptial f&ecirc;te that occurs in this work, the reader may perhaps desire some introductory
information, which I shall here endeavour to convey in such a manner as to make the
present note serve to illustrate many future allusions in these pages, and not merely
the foregoing tale.</p>

<p>Marriage is regarded by the Muslims in general as a positive duty; and to neglect
it, without a sufficient excuse, subjects a man to severe reproach. "When a servant
[of God]," said the Prophet, "marries, verily he perfects half his religion."<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> He once
asked a man, "Art thou married?" The man answered, "No." "And art thou,"
said he, "sound and healthy?" The answer was, "Yes." "Then," said Mo&#7717;ammad,
"thou art one of the brothers of the devils; for the most wicked among you are the
unmarried; and the most vile among your dead are the unmarried; moreover the
married are those who are acquitted of filthy conversation; and by Him in whose
hand is my soul, the devil hath not a weapon more effective against the virtuous, both
men and women, than the neglect of marriage."<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> Some remarks on this subject, and
on the advantages of marriage, have been made in a preceding note on infancy and
education.</p>

<p>The number of wives whom a Muslim may have at the same time is four. He may
marry free women, or take concubine slaves, or have of both these classes. It is the
opinion of most persons, I believe, among the more strictly religious, that a man may
not have more than four women, whether they be wives alone, or concubine slaves alone,
or of both classes together; but the practice of some of the Companions of the
Prophet, who cannot be accused of violating his precepts, affords a strong argument to
the contrary. 'Alee, it is said, "was the most devout of the Companions; but he had
four wives and seventeen concubines besides, and married, after F&aacute;&#7789;imeh (may God be
well pleased with her!), among all that he married and divorced, more than two
hundred women: and sometimes he included four wives in one contract, and sometimes
divorced four at one time, taking other four in their stead."<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> This may perhaps be
an exaggerated statement: but it is certain that the custom of keeping an unlimited
number of concubines was common among wealthy Muslims in the first century of the
Mohammadan era, and has so continued. The famous author of the work above quoted
urges the example of Solomon to prove that the possession of numerous concubines is
not inconsistent with piety and good morals; not considering that God made but one
wife for Adam.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned in the first of the notes to this work, that a Muslim may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>divorce his wife twice, and each time take her back. This he may do, even against her
wish, during a fixed period, which cannot extend beyond three months, unless she be
<i>enceinte</i>, in which latter case she must wait until the birth of her child before she will
be at liberty to contract a new marriage. During this period the husband is obliged to
maintain her. If he divorce her a third time, or by a triple sentence, he cannot take
her again unless with her own consent, and by a new contract, and after another
marriage has been consummated between her and another husband, and this husband
also has divorced her.</p>

<p>It is not a common custom, especially among the middle ranks, for an Arab to have
more than one wife at the same time; but there are few of middle age who have not had
several different wives at different periods, tempted to change by the facility of divorce.
The case of 'Alee has been mentioned above. Mugheyreh Ibn-She&#7841;beh married eighty
women in the course of his life;<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> and several more remarkable instances of the love of
change are recorded by Arab writers: the most extraordinary case of this kind that I
have met with was that of Mo&#7717;ammad Ibn-E&#7789;-&#7788;eiyib, the Dyer, of Baghd&aacute;d, who died
in the year of the Flight 423, aged eighty-five years; of whom it is related, on most
respectable authority, that he married more than nine hundred women!<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>&mdash;Supposing,
therefore, that he married his first wife when he was fifteen years of age, he must have
had, on the average, nearly thirteen wives <i>per annum</i>. The women, in general, cannot
of course marry so many successive husbands, not only because a woman cannot have
more than one husband at a time, but also because she cannot divorce her husband.
There have been, however, many instances of Arab women who have married a surprising
number of men in rapid succession. Among these may be mentioned Umm-Kh&aacute;rijeh,
who gave occasion to a proverb on this subject. This woman, who was of
the tribe of Bejeeleh, in El-Yemen, married upwards of forty husbands; and her son
Kh&aacute;rijeh knew not who was his father. She used to contract a marriage in the quickest
possible manner: a man saying to her, "Khi&#7789;bun" (betrothal), she replied, "Nik-&#7717;un"
(marriage), and thus became his lawful wife. She had a very numerous progeny;
several tribes originating from her.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p>For the choice of a wife, a man generally relies on his mother, or some other near
female relation, or a professional female betrother (who is called "kh&aacute;&#7789;ibeh"); for there
are many women who perform this office for hire. The law allows him to see the face of
the female whom he proposes to marry, previously to his making the contract; but in
the present day this liberty is seldom obtained, except among the lower orders.
Unless in this case, a man is not allowed to see unveiled any woman but his own wife
or slave, and those women to whom the law prohibits his uniting himself in marriage:
nay, according to some, he is not allowed to "see" his own niece unveiled, though he
may not marry her. It should be added, that a slave may lawfully see the face of his
own mistress; but this privilege is seldom granted in the present day to any slave but
a eunuch. An infringement of the law above mentioned is held to be extremely sinful
in both parties: "The curse of God," said the Prophet, "is on the seer and the seen:"
yet it is very often disregarded in the case of women of the lower orders.</p>

<p>A man is forbidden, by the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> and the Sunneh, to marry his mother, or other
ascendant; daughter, or other descendant; his sister, or half-sister; the sister of his
father or mother or other ascendant; his niece, or any of her descendants; his foster-mother
who has suckled him five times in the course of the first two years, or a woman
related to him by milk in any of the degrees which would preclude his marriage with
her if she were similarly related to him by consanguinity; the mother of his wife, even
if he has not consummated his marriage with this wife; the daughter of his wife, if he
has consummated his marriage with the latter (but if he has not done so, and this wife
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>is divorced from him, or dead, he may marry her daughter); his father's wife, and his
son's wife; and to have at the same time two wives who are sisters, or aunt and niece:
he is forbidden also to marry his unemancipated slave, or another man's slave if he has
already a free wife; and to marry any woman but one of his own faith, or a Christian,
or a Jewess. A Mohammadan woman, however, may only marry a man of her own
faith. An unlawful intercourse with any woman prevents a man from marrying any of
her relations who would be forbidden to him if she were his wife.</p>

<p>The reader has already seen that a cousin (the daughter of a paternal uncle) is often
chosen as a wife, on account of the tie of blood, which is likely to attach her more
strongly to her husband, or on account of an affection conceived in early years. Parity
of rank is generally much regarded; and a man is often unable to obtain as his wife
the daughter of one of a different profession or trade, unless an inferior; or a younger
daughter when an elder remains unmarried. A girl is often married at the age of
twelve years, and sometimes at ten, or even nine: the usual period is between twelve
and sixteen years. At the age of thirteen or fourteen she may be a mother. The
young men marry a few years later.</p>

<p>The most important requisite in a wife is religion. The Prophet said, "A virtuous
wife is better than the world and all that it contains." "A virtuous wife," said
Lu&#7731;m&aacute;n, "is like a crown on the head of a king; and a wicked wife is like a heavy
burden on the back of an old man." Among the other chief requisites are agreeableness
of temper, and beauty of form (undiminished by any defect or irregularity of
features or members), moderation in the amount of dowry required, and good birth.
It is said, "if thou marry not a virgin, [which is most desirable,] marry a divorced
woman, and not a widow; for the divorced woman will respect thy words when thou
sayest, 'If there were any good in thee thou hadst not been divorced;' whereas the
widow will say, 'May God have mercy on such a one! he hath left me to one unsuited
to me.'" But according to another selfish maxim, the woman most to be avoided is she
who is divorced from a man by whom she has had a child; for her heart is with him,
and she is an enemy to the man who marries her after.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a>&mdash;Modesty is a requisite upon
which too much stress cannot be laid; but this, to an English reader, requires some
explanation. 'Alee asked his wife F&aacute;&#7789;imeh, "Who is the best of women?" She
answered, "She who sees not men, and whom they see not."<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> Modesty, therefore, in
the opinion of the Muslims, is most eminently shown by a woman's concealing her
person, and restraining her eyes, from men. "The best rank of men [in a mosque],"
said the Prophet, "is the front; and the best rank of women is the rear:"<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> that is,
those most distant from the men: but better than even these are the women who pray
at home.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a>&mdash;Fruitfulness is also a desirable qualification to be considered in the choice
of a wife: "it may be known in maidens," says the Prophet, "from their relations;
because, generally speaking, kindred are similar in disposition, &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> Lastly, contentment
is to be enumerated among the requisites. It is said, on the same authority,
"Verily the best of women are those that are most content with little."<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> To obtain a
contented and submissive wife, many men make their selection from among the classes
inferior to them in rank. Others, with a similar view, prefer a concubine slave in the
place of a wife.</p>

<p>The consent of a girl not arrived at the age of puberty is not required: her father,
or, if he is dead, her nearest adult male relation, or a guardian appointed by will or by
the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee, acts as her wekeel, or deputy, to effect the  marriage-contract for her. If of
age, she appoints her own deputy. A dowry is required to legalize the marriage; and the
least dowry allowed by the law is ten dirhems, or drachms of silver; about five shillings
of our money. Mo&#7717;ammad married certain of his wives for a dowry of ten dirhems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>and the household necessaries, which were a handmill to grind the corn, a water-jar,
and a pillow of skin or leather stuffed with the fibres of the palm-tree, which are called
"leef:" but some he married for a dowry of five hundred dirhems.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> With the increase
of wealth and luxury, dowries have increased in amount; but, to our ideas, they are
still trifling; a sum equivalent to about twenty pounds sterling being a common dowry
among Arabs of the middle classes for a virgin, and half or a third or quarter of that
sum for a divorced woman or a widow. Two-thirds of the sum is usually paid before
making the contract, and the remaining portion held in reserve to be paid to the woman
in case of her divorce or in case of the husband's death. The father or guardian of a
girl under age receives the former portion of her dowry; but it is considered as her
property, and he generally expends it, with an additional sum from his own purse, in
the purchase of necessary furniture, dress, &amp;c., for her, which the husband can never
take from her against her own wish.</p>

<p>The marriage-contract is generally, in the present day, merely verbal; but sometimes
a certificate is written, and sealed by the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee. The most approved or propitious
period for this act is the month of Showw&aacute;l: the most unpropitious, Mo&#7717;arram. The
only persons whose presence is required to perform it are the bridegroom (or his deputy),
the bride's deputy (who is the betrother), two male witnesses, if such can be easily
procured, and the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee or a schoolmaster or some other person to recite a khu&#7789;beh,
which consists of a few words in praise of God, a form of blessing on the Prophet, and
some passages of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, respecting marriage. They all recite the F&aacute;t'&#7717;ah (or
opening chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n), after which the bridegroom pays the money. The
latter and the bride's deputy then seat themselves on the ground, face to face, and
grasp each other's right hand, raising the thumbs, and pressing them against each
other. Previously to the khu&#7789;beh, the person who recites this formula places a handkerchief
over the two joined hands; and after the khu&#7789;beh he dictates to the two contracting
parties what they are to say. The betrother generally uses the following or a
similar form of words: "I betroth to thee my daughter [or her for whom I act as
deputy] such a one [naming the bride], the virgin, [or the adult virgin, &amp;c.,] for a dowry
of such an amount." The bridegroom answers, "I accept from thee her betrothal to
myself." This is all that is absolutely necessary; but the address and reply are usually
repeated a second and third time, and are often expressed in fuller forms of words. The
contract is concluded with the recital of the F&aacute;t'&#7717;ah by all persons present.</p>

<p>This betrothal, or marriage-contract, is often performed several years before the
consummation, when the two parties are yet children; or during the infancy of the
girl; but generally not more than about eight or ten days before the former event.
The household furniture and dress prepared for the bride are sent by her family to the
bridegroom's house, usually conveyed by a train of camels, two or three or more days
before she is conducted thither.</p>

<p>The feasts and processions which are now to be mentioned are only observed in the
case of a virgin bride; a widow or divorced woman being remarried in a private manner.
I describe them chiefly in accordance with the usages of Cairo, which appear to me
most agreeable, in general, with the descriptions and allusions in the present work.&mdash;The
period most commonly approved for the consummation of marriage is the eve of
Friday, or that of Monday. Previously to this event, the bridegroom once or twice or
more frequently gives a feast to his friends; and for several nights, his house and the
houses of his near neighbours are usually illuminated by numerous clusters of lamps, or
by lanterns, suspended in front of them; some, to cords drawn across the street. To
these or other cords are also suspended small flags, or square pieces of silk, each of two
different colours, generally red and green. Some say that the feast or feasts should be
given on the occasion of the contract; others, on the consummation; others, again, on
both these occasions.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> The usual custom of the people of Cairo is to give a feast on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>the night immediately preceding that of the consummation, and another on the latter
night; but some commence their feasts earlier. Respecting marriage-feasts, the Prophet
said, "The first day's feast is an incumbent duty; and the second day's, a sunneh
ordinance; and the third day's, for ostentation and notoriety:" and he forbade eating
at the feast of the ostentatious.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> It is a positive duty to accept an invitation to a
marriage-feast or other lawful entertainment; but the guest is not obliged to eat.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a>
The persons invited, and all intimate friends, generally send presents of provisions of
some kind a day or two before. The Prophet taught that marriage-feasts should be
frugal: the best that <i>he</i> gave was with one goat.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> He approved of demonstrations of
joy at the celebration of a marriage with songs, and, according to one tradition, by the
beating of deffs (or tambourines); but in another tradition the latter practice is condemned.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a>
The preferable mode of entertaining the guests is by the performance of
a zikr.</p>

<p>The bride is conducted to the bridegroom's house in the afternoon immediately preceding
the night of consummation. On the day next preceding that on which she is
conducted thither, she goes to the public bath, accompanied by a number of her female
relations and friends. The procession generally pursues a circuitous route, for the sake
of greater display; and on leaving the house, turns to the right. In Cairo, the bride
walks under a canopy of silk borne by four men, with one of her near female relations
on each side of her. Young unmarried girls walk before her; these are preceded by the
married ladies; and the procession is headed and closed by a few musicians with drums
and hautboys. The bride wears a kind of pasteboard crown, or cap; and is completely
veiled from the view of spectators by a Kashmeer shawl placed over her crown and
whole person; but some handsome ornaments of the head are attached externally. The
other women are dressed in the best of their walking-attire. In the case, however, of a
bride of high rank, or of wealth, and often in the case of one belonging to a family of
the middle class, the ladies ride upon high-saddled asses, without music or canopy; and
the bride is only distinguished by a Kashmeer shawl instead of the usual black silk
covering; one or more eunuchs sometimes riding at the head. In the bath, after the
ordinary operations of washing, &amp;c., a feast is made, and the party are often entertained
by female singers. Having returned in the same manner to her home, the bride's
friends there partake of a similar entertainment with her. Her hands and feet are
then stained with &#7717;enn&agrave;, and her eyes ornamented with ko&#7717;l; and her friends give her
small presents of money, and take their leave. "It is a sunneh ordinance that the
bride wash her feet in a clean vessel, and sprinkle the water in the corners of the
chamber, that a blessing may result from this. She should also brighten her face, and
put on the best of her apparel, and adorn her eyes with ko&#7717;l, and stain [her hands and
feet] with &#7717;enn&agrave; [as above mentioned]; and she should abstain, during the first week,
from eating anything that contains mustard, and from vinegar, and sour apples."<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>The bride is conducted to the house of the bridegroom (on the following day) in the
same manner as to the bath, or with more pomp. In Cairo, the bridal processions of
persons of very high rank are conducted with singular display. The train is usually
headed by buffoons and musicians, and a water-carrier loaded with a goat's-skin filled
with sand and water, of very great weight, which is often borne for many hours before,
as well as during, the procession, merely to amuse the spectators by this feat of strength.
Then follow (interrupted by groups of male or female dancers, jugglers, &amp;c.) numerous
decorated open waggons, or cars, each of which contains several members of some particular
trade or art engaged in their ordinary occupations, or one such person with
attendants: in one, for instance, a &#7731;ahwejee (or &#7731;ahvejee), with his assistants and pots
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>and cups and fire, making coffee for the spectators: in a second, makers of sweetmeats:
in a third, makers of pancakes (fa&#7789;eerehs): in a fourth, silk-lace manufacturers: in a
fifth, a silk-weaver, with his loom: in a sixth, tinners of copper vessels, at their work:
in a seventh, white-washers, whitening over and over again a wall: in short, almost
every manufacture, &amp;c., has its representatives in a different waggon. El-Jabartee
describes a procession of this kind in which there were upwards of seventy parties of
different trades and arts, each party in a separate waggon, besides buffoons, wrestlers,
dancers, and others; followed by various officers, the eunuchs of the bride's family,
ladies of the &#7717;areem with their attendants, then the bride, in a European carriage, a
troop of memlooks clad in armour, and a Turkish band of music. It was a procession
of which the like had not before been seen.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<p>The bride and her party, having arrived at the house, sit down to a repast. The
bridegroom does not yet see her. He has already been to the bath, and at nightfall he
goes in procession with a number of his friends to a mosque, to perform the night-prayers;
he is accompanied by musicians and singers, or by chanters of lyric odes in
praise of the Prophet; and by men bearing cressets (poles with cylindrical frames of
iron at the top filled with flaming wood); and on his return, most of his other attendants
bear lighted wax candles, and bunches of flowers.</p>

<p>Returned to his house, he leaves his friends in a lower apartment, and goes up to
the bride, whom he finds seated, with a shawl thrown over her head, so as to conceal
her face completely, and attended by one or two females. The latter he induces to
retire, by means of a small present. He then gives a present of money to the bride, as
"the price of uncovering the face," and having removed the covering (saying, as he does
so, "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful"), he beholds her, generally,
for the first time. On the occasion of this first visit, which is called the "dukhool," or
"dukhleh," he is recommended "to perfume himself, and to sprinkle some sugar and
almonds on the head of the bride and on that of each woman with her; this practice
being established by existing usage and by traditions: also, when he approaches her,
he should perform the prayers of two rek'ahs; and she should do the same if able: then
he should take hold of the hair over her forehead, and say, 'O God, bless me in my wife,
and bless my wife in me! O God, bestow upon me [offspring] by her, and bestow upon
her [offspring] by me! O God, unite us, as Thou hast united, happily; and separate us,
when Thou separatest, happily!'"<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV40" id="IV40">40.</a></span> The &#7789;arboosh is a woollen skull-cap, of a deep blood-red colour, having a
tassel of dark blue silk attached to the crown. It is now worn by most Arabs of the
higher and middle classes, and by many others, except in Arabia, where it is not so
common. Round it is wound the muslin or shawl which forms the turban. Within it
is worn a cotton cap. The Turks call it "fes," and "f&eacute;s."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV41" id="IV41">41.</a></span> The farajeeyeh is a loose robe or coat, now generally made of cloth, with
full and long sleeves extending a little beyond the extremities of the fingers and without
any slit. It is worn chiefly by persons of the learned professions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV42" id="IV42">42.</a></span> This is the usual mode in which money is collected for the singing-women

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV43" id="IV43">43.</a></span> "&#7716;ooreeyeh" is the appellation commonly given by the Arabs to a
virgin of Paradise, by French and English writers, termed "Houri;" which term, in
Arabic, converts a female into a male, but is agreeable with the Persian equivalent of
the Arabic "&#7716;ooreeyeh."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV44" id="IV44">44.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Evil Eye.</i> Some remarks on the "evil eye" have been made in
a former note (No. 24 in the present series), with respect to children, and the means of
counteracting its supposed influence; but I mention this subject again partly with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>view of suggesting to the reader the necessity of bearing it in mind, as it explains
many usages described, or alluded to, in this work, which would otherwise appear
unaccountable. He may remember a well-known line of Virgil&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos,"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>which, like many other allusions in works of ancient authors, shews how long and how
extensively this superstition has been entertained. How deeply it is rooted in the
minds of Arabs, even the most religious and learned, may be inferred from this saying
of their Prophet: "The eye has a complete influence; because verily, if there were a
thing to overcome fate, it most certainly would be a malignant eye."<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> Hence he permitted
charms (which he disallowed in almost every other case) to be employed for the
purpose of counteracting its influence.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> The following observation, selected from
several of a similar nature in my work on the Modern Egyptians, aptly illustrates the
passage to which this note immediately refers. "It is a custom among the higher and
middle classes in Cairo, on the occasion of a marriage, to hang chandeliers in the street
before the bridegroom's house; and it often happens that a crowd is collected to see a
very large and handsome chandelier suspended: in this case, it is a common practice to
divert the attention of the spectators by throwing down and breaking a large jar, or by
some other artifice, lest an envious eye should cause the chandelier to fall."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV45" id="IV45">45.</a></span> The closet here alluded to, being one in which ablution is performed,
always contains a small trough of water, or a ewer.</p>

that the person to be adopted consents to the act, if of age to judge for himself;
also, that he has been deprived of his parents by death or other means; and that there
be such a difference of age between the two parties as might subsist between a natural
father and his son. The adopted son enjoys the same right of inheritance as the natural
son; but the adoptive father is not prevented by this act from marrying any relation
of his adopted son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV52" id="IV52">52.</a></span> In the houses of Arabs of the more wealthy classes, there is usually a
chair upon which the turban is placed at night. It is of a large size, but slight make;
the bottom and back being generally of cane-work; and sometimes it has a kind of
canopy constructed over it. The turban, when placed upon it, is covered with a kerchief
of thick silk stuff, often embroidered or interwoven with gold thread.</p>

points, this name is converted into "Ez-Zebed&aacute;neeyeh."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV64" id="IV64">64.</a></span> The word which I translate "a cross," literally signifies "an effigy;"
but I suppose this term to be employed merely because a cross bears a rude resemblance
to a man with extended arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV65" id="IV65">65.</a></span> "The name of Allah encompass thee!" (or, literally, "&mdash;be around thee!")
is an ejaculation often used, especially by women, agreeing exactly with the expression
in the first verse of the twentieth Psalm,&mdash;"The name of the God of Jacob defend thee!"&mdash;the
"name" of God here signifying his power. "The name of the Lord is a strong
tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe." (Proverbs xviii. 10.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV66" id="IV66">66.</a></span> Here, for a reason given above, I have substituted "twelve" for "ten."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV67" id="IV67">67.</a></span> In the original, the last of these verses is here omitted, but my sheykh
has supplied it in the margin of my copy, and it occurs afterwards, in the 75th night,
in which the preceding verses, with some slight variations, are repeated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV68" id="IV68">68.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Expiation of Oaths.</i> The law clearly allows expiation for an inconsiderate
oath, and, according to vulgar opinion, for the violation of a deliberate oath.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a>
The expiation consists in once feeding or clothing ten poor men, liberating a Muslim
slave or captive, or fasting three days. An unintentional oath requires no expiation;
but the swearing to a falsehood can only be expiated by deep repentance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="IV69" id="IV69">69.</a></span> Hole observes (page 222), that "the discovery of Bedreddin in the Arabian
Nights by the tarts he had made, bears internal evidence of having been copied from
Nella Raja's detection by the same means:" and he refers to Kindersley's "Specimens
of Indian Literature."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h6>COMMENCING WITH PART OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH NIGHT, AND ENDING
WITH PART OF THE THIRTY-SECOND.</h6>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE HUMPBACK.</h5>

<p>There was, in ancient times, in the city of El-Ba&#7779;rah,<a href="#V1" class="fnanchor">1</a> a tailor
who enjoyed an ample income, and was fond of sport and merriment.
He was in the habit of going out occasionally with his wife, that they
might amuse themselves with strange and diverting scenes; and one
day they went forth in the afternoon,<a href="#V2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and, returning home in the
evening, met a humpbacked man, whose aspect was such as to excite
laughter in the angry, and to dispel anxiety and grief: so they approached
him to enjoy the pleasure of gazing at him, and invited him
to return with them to their house, and to join with them in a carousal
that night.</p>

<p>He assented to their proposal; and after he had gone with them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
to the house, the tailor went out to the market; night having then
approached. He bought some dried fish, and bread and limes and
sweetmeat, and, returning with them, placed the fish before the humpback
and they sat down to eat; and the tailor's wife took a large
piece of fish, and crammed the humpback with it, and, closing his
mouth with her hand, said, By Allah, thou shalt not swallow it but
by gulping it at once, and I will not give thee time to chew it. He
therefore swallowed it; but it contained a large and sharp bone, which
stuck across in his throat, his destiny having so determined, and he
expired. The tailor exclaimed, There is no strength nor power but in
God the High, the Great! Alas, that this poor creature should not
have died but in this manner by our hands!&mdash;Wherefore this idling?
exclaimed the woman.&mdash;And what can I do? asked her husband.&mdash;Arise
she answered, and take him in thy bosom, and cover him with
a silk napkin: I will go out first and do thou follow me, this very
night and say, This is my son, and this is his mother; and we are
going to convey him to the physician, that he may give him some
medicine.</p>

<p>No sooner had the tailor heard these words than he arose, and
took the humpback in his bosom. His wife, accompanying him, exclaimed,
O my child! may Allah preserve thee! Where is the part in
which thou feelest pain; and where hath this small-pox attacked thee?&mdash;So
every one who saw them said, They are conveying a child smitten
with the small-pox. Thus they proceeded, inquiring as they went,
for the abode of the physician; and the people directed them to the
house of a physician who was a Jew; and they knocked at the door,
and there came down to them a black slave-girl, who opened the door,
and beheld a man carrying (as she imagined) a child, and attended by
its mother; and she said, What is your business?&mdash;We have a child
here answered the tailor's wife, and we want the physician to see him:
take, then, this quarter of a piece of gold, and give it to thy master, and
let him come down and see my son; for he is ill. The girl, therefore,
went up, and the tailor's wife, entering the vestibule, said to her husband,
Leave the humpback here, and let us take ourselves away. And
the tailor, accordingly, set him up against the wall, and went out with
his wife.</p>

<p>The slave-girl, meanwhile, went in to the Jew, and said to him,
Below, in the house, is a sick person, with a woman and a man: and
they have given me a quarter of a piece of gold for thee, that thou
mayest prescribe for them what may suit his case. And when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Jew saw the quarter of a piece of gold, he rejoiced, and, rising in
haste, went down in the dark; and in doing so, his foot struck against
the lifeless humpback. O Ezra! he exclaimed&mdash;O Heavens and the
Ten Commandments! O Aaron, and Joshua son of Nun! It seemeth
that I have stumbled against this sick person, and he hath fallen down
the stairs and died! And how shall I go forth with one killed from
my house? O Ezra's ass!<a href="#V3" class="fnanchor">3</a>&mdash;He then raised him, and took him up
from the court of the house to his wife, and acquainted her with the
accident.&mdash;And why sittest thou here idle? said she; for if thou remain
thus until daybreak our lives will be lost: let me and thee, then,
take him up to the terrace, and throw him into the house of our
neighbour the Muslim; for he is the steward of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n's kitchen,
and often do the cats come to his house, and eat of the food which
they find there;<a href="#V4" class="fnanchor">4</a> as do the mice too: and if he remain there for a
night, the dogs will come down to him from the terraces and eat him
up entirely.<a href="#V5" class="fnanchor">5</a> So the Jew and his wife went up, carrying the humpback,
and let him down by his hands and feet to the pavement;
placing him against the wall; which having done, they descended.</p>

<p>Not long had the humpback been thus deposited when the steward
returned to his house, and opened the door, and, going up with a
lighted candle in his hand, found a son of Adam standing in the
corner next the kitchen; upon which he exclaimed, What is this?
By Allah, the thief that hath stolen our goods is none other than a
son of Adam, who taketh what he findeth of flesh or grease, even
though I keep it concealed from the cats and the dogs; and if I killed
all the cats and dogs of the quarter it would be of no use; for he
cometh down from the terraces!&mdash;And so saying, he took up a great
mallet, and struck him with it, and then, drawing close to him, gave
him a second blow with it upon the chest, when the humpback fell
down, and he found that he was dead; whereupon he grieved, and
said, There is no strength nor power but in God! And he feared for
himself, and exclaimed, Curse upon the grease and the flesh, and upon
this night, in which the destiny of this man hath been accomplished
by my hand! Then, looking upon him, and perceiving that he was
a humpback, he said, Is it not enough that thou art humpbacked, but
must thou also be a robber, and steal the flesh and the grease? O
Protector, cover me with thy gracious shelter!&mdash;And he lifted him
upon his shoulders, and descended, and went forth from his house,
towards the close of the night, and stopped not until he had conveyed
him to the commencement of the market-street, where he placed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
upon his feet by the side of a shop at the entrance of a lane, and there
left him and retired.</p>

<p>Soon after, there came a Christian, the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n's broker, who, in a
state of intoxication, had come forth to visit the bath; and he advanced,
staggering, until he drew near to the humpback, when he turned his
eyes, and beheld one standing by him. Now some persons had
snatched off his turban early in the night,<a href="#V6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and when he saw the
humpback standing there, he concluded that he intended to do the
same; so he clenched his fist, and struck him on the neck. Down fell
the humpback upon the ground, and the Christian called out to the
watchman of the market,<a href="#V7" class="fnanchor">7</a> while, still in the excess of his intoxication,
he continued beating the humpback, and attempting to throttle him.
As he was thus employed, the watchman came, and, finding the
Christian kneeling upon the Muslim<a href="#V8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and beating him, said, Arise,
and quit him! He arose, therefore, and the watchman, approaching
the humpback, saw that he was dead, and exclaimed, How is it that
the Christian dareth to kill the Muslim? Then seizing the Christian,
he bound his hands behind him, and took him to the house of the
W&aacute;lee;<a href="#V9" class="fnanchor">9</a> the Christian saying within himself, O Heavens! O Virgin!
how have I killed this man? and how quickly did he die from a
blow of the hand!&mdash;Intoxication had departed, and reflection had
come.</p>

<p>The humpback and the Christian passed the remainder of the
night in the house of the W&aacute;lee, and the W&aacute;lee ordered the executioner
to proclaim the Christian's crime, and he set up a gallows, and
stationed him beneath it. The executioner then came, and threw the
rope round his neck, and was about to hang him, when the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n's
steward pushed through the crowd, seeing the Christian standing
beneath the gallows, and the people made way for him, and he said to
the executioner, Do it not; for it was I who killed him.&mdash;Wherefore
didst thou kill him? said the W&aacute;lee. He answered, I went into my
house last night, and saw that he had descended from the terrace and
stolen my goods; so I struck him with a mallet upon his chest, and
he died, and I carried him out, and conveyed him to the market-street,
where I set him up in such a place, at the entrance of such a lane. Is
it not enough for me to have killed a Muslim, that a Christian should
be killed on my account? Hang, then, none but me.&mdash;The W&aacute;lee,
therefore, when he heard these words, liberated the Christian broker, and
said to the executioner, Hang this man, on the ground of his confession.
And he took off the rope from the neck of the Christian, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
put it round the neck of the steward, and, having stationed him beneath
the gallows, was about to hang him, when the Jewish physician pushed
through the crowd, and called out to the executioner, saying to him,
Do it not; for none killed him but I; and the case was this: he came
to my house to be cured of a disease, and as I descended to him I
struck against him with my foot, and he died: kill not the steward,
therefore; but kill me. So the W&aacute;lee gave orders to hang the Jewish
physician; and the executioner took off the rope from the steward's
neck, and put it round the neck of the Jew. But, lo, the tailor came,
and, forcing his way among the people, said to the executioner, Do it
not; for none killed him but I; and it happened thus: I was out
amusing myself during the day, and as I was returning at the commencement
of the night, I met this humpback in a state of intoxication,
with a tambourine, and singing merrily; and I stopped to divert
myself by looking at him, and took him to my house. I then bought
some fish, and we sat down to eat, and my wife took a piece of fish
and a morsel of bread, and crammed them into his mouth, and he was
choked, and instantly died. Then I and my wife took him to the
house of the Jew, and the girl came down and opened the door, and
while she went up to her master, I set up the humpback by the stairs,
and went away with my wife: so, when the Jew came down and
stumbled against him, he thought that he had killed him.&mdash;And he
said to the Jew, Is this true? He answered, Yes. The tailor, then,
looking towards the W&aacute;lee, said to him, Liberate the Jew, and hang
me. And when the W&aacute;lee heard this he was astonished at the case of
the humpback, and said, Verily this is an event that should be recorded
in books! And he said to the executioner, Liberate the Jew,
and hang the tailor on account of his own confession. So the executioner
led him forward, saying, Dost thou put forward this and take
back that; and shall we not hang one? And he put the rope round
the neck of the tailor.</p>

<p>Now the humpback was the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n's buffoon, and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n
could not bear him to be out of his sight; and when the humpback
had got drunk, and been absent that night and the next day until
noon, the King inquired respecting him of some of his attendants, and
they answered him, O our lord, the W&aacute;lee hath taken him forth dead,
and gave orders to hang the person who killed him, and there came a
second and a third person, each saying, None killed him but I:&mdash;and
describing to the W&aacute;lee the cause of his killing him. When the King,
therefore, heard this, he called out to the Chamberlain, and said to him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Go down to the W&aacute;lee, and bring them all hither before me. So the
Chamberlain went down, and found that the executioner had almost
put to death the tailor, and he called out to him, saying, Do it not:&mdash;and
informed the W&aacute;lee that the case had been reported to the King.
And he took him, and the humpback borne with him, and the tailor
and the Jew and the Christian and the steward, and went up with
them all to the King; and when the W&aacute;lee came into the presence of
the King, he kissed the ground, and related to him all that had
happened. And the King was astonished, and was moved with merriment,
at hearing this tale; and he commanded that it should be
written in letters of gold. He then said to those who were present,
Have ye ever heard anything like the story of this humpback? And
upon this the Christian advanced, and said, O King of the age, if thou
permit me I will relate to thee an event that hath occurred to me more
wonderful and strange and exciting than the story of the humpback.&mdash;Tell
us then thy story, said the King. And the Christian related as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY TOLD BY THE CHRISTIAN BROKER.</h5>

<p>Know, O King of the age, that I came to this country with merchandise,
and destiny stayed me among your people. I was born in
Cairo, and am one of its Copts, and there I was brought up. My
father was a broker; and when I had attained to manhood, he died,
and I succeeded to his business; and as I was sitting one day, lo, a
young man of most handsome aspect, and clad in a dress of the richest
description, came to me, riding upon an ass, and, when he saw me,
saluted me; whereupon I rose to him, to pay him honour, and he produced
a handkerchief containing some sesame, and said, What is the
value of an ardebb<a href="#V10" class="fnanchor">10</a> of this? I answered him, A hundred pieces of
silver. And he said to me, Take the carriers and the measurers, and
repair to the Kh&aacute;n of El-J&aacute;walee<a href="#V11" class="fnanchor">11</a> in the district of B&aacute;b en-Na&#7779;r:<a href="#V12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
there wilt thou find me. And he left me and went his way, after
having given me the handkerchief with the sample of the sesame. So
I went about to the purchasers; and the price of each ardebb amounted
to a hundred and twenty pieces of silver; and I took with me four
carriers, and went to him. I found him waiting my arrival; and when
he saw me he rose and opened a magazine, and we measured its contents,
and the whole amounted to fifty ardebbs. The young man then
said, Thou shalt have, for every ardebb, ten pieces of silver as brokerage;
and do thou receive the price and keep it in thy care: the whole
sum will be five thousand; and thy share of it, five hundred: so there
will remain for me four thousand and five hundred; and when I shall
have finished the sale of the goods contained in my store-rooms, I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
come to thee and receive it. I replied, It shall be as thou desirest.
And I kissed his hand, and left him. Thus there accrued to me, on
that day, a thousand pieces of silver, besides my brokerage.<a href="#V13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>He was absent from me a month, at the expiration of which he
came and said to me, Where is the money? I answered, Here it is,
ready. And he said, Keep it until I come to thee to receive it. And
I remained expecting him; but he was absent from me another month;
after which he came again, and said, Where is the money? Whereupon
I arose and saluted him, and said to him, Wilt thou eat something
with us? He, however, declined, and said, Keep the money
until I shall have gone and returned to receive it from thee. He
then departed; and I arose, and prepared for him the money, and sat
expecting him; but again he absented himself from me for a month, and
then came and said, After this day I will receive it from thee. And
he departed, and I made ready the money for him as before, and sat
waiting his return. Again, however, he remained a month absent
from me, and I said within myself, Verily this young man is endowed
with consummate liberality! After the month he came, attired in rich
clothing, and resembling the full moon, appearing as if he had just
come out of the bath, with red cheek and fair forehead, and a mole like
a globule of ambergris. When I beheld him I kissed his hand, and
invoked a blessing upon him, and said to him, O my master, wilt thou
not take thy money?&mdash;Have patience with me, he answered, until I
shall have transacted all my affairs, after which I will receive it from
thee. And so saying, he departed; and I said within myself, By
Allah, when he cometh I will entertain him as a guest, on account of
the profit which I have derived from his money; for great wealth hath
accrued to me from it.</p>

<p>At the close of the year he returned, clad in a dress richer than
the former; and I swore to him that he should alight to be my guest.&mdash;On
the condition, he replied, that thou expend nothing of my
money that is in thy possession. I said, Well:&mdash;and, having seated
him, prepared what was requisite of meats and drinks and other provisions,
and placed them before him, saying, In the name of Allah!
And he drew near to the table, and put forth his left hand, and thus
ate with me: so I was surprised at him;<a href="#V14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and when we had finished
he washed his hand, and I gave him a napkin with which to wipe it.
We then sat down to converse, and I said, O my master dispel a
trouble from my mind. Wherefore didst thou eat with thy left hand?
Probably something paineth thee in thy right hand?&mdash;On hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
these words, he stretched forth his arm from his sleeve,<a href="#V15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and behold,
it was maimed&mdash;an arm without a hand! And I wondered at this;
but he said to me, Wonder not; nor say in thy heart that I ate with
thee with my left hand from a motive of self-conceit; for rather to be
wondered at is the cause of the cutting off of my right hand. And
what, said I, was the cause of it? He answered, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Know that I am from Baghd&aacute;d: my father was one of the chief
people of that city; and when I had attained the age of manhood, I
heard the wanderers and travellers and merchants conversing respecting
the land of Egypt, and their words remained in my heart until my
father died, when I took large sums of money, and prepared merchandise
consisting of the stuffs of Baghd&aacute;d and of El-M&oacute;&#7779;il, and similar
precious goods, and, having packed them up, journeyed from Baghd&aacute;d;
and God decreed me safety until I entered this your city. And so
saying, he wept, and repeated these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The blear-eyed escapeth a pit into which the clear-sighted falleth;</span>
<span class="i0">And the ignorant, an expression by which the shrewd sage is ruined.</span>
<span class="i0">The believer can scarce earn his food, while the impious infidel is favoured.</span>
<span class="i0">What art or act can a man devise? It is what the Almighty appointeth!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I entered Cairo, continued the young man, and deposited the stuffs
in the Kh&aacute;n of Mesroor,<a href="#V16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and, having unbound my packages and put
them in the magazines, gave to the servant some money to buy for
us something to eat, after which I slept a little; and when I arose, I
went to Beyn el-&#7730;a&#7779;reyn.<a href="#V17" class="fnanchor">17</a> I then returned, and passed the night;
and in the morning following, I opened a bale of stuff, and said within
myself, I will arise and go through some of the market-streets, and see
the state of the mart. So I took some stuff, and made some of my
servants carry it, and proceeded until I arrived at the &#7730;eys&aacute;reeyeh of
Jah&aacute;rkas,<a href="#V18" class="fnanchor">18</a> where the brokers came to me, having heard of my arrival,
and took from me the stuff, and cried it about for sale; but the price
bidden amounted not to the prime cost. And upon this the Sheykh
of the brokers said to me, O my master, I know a plan by which thou
mayest profit; and it is this: that thou do as other merchants, and
sell thy merchandise upon credit for a certain period, employing a
scrivener and a witness and a money-changer, and receive a portion of
the profits every Thursday and Monday; so shalt thou make of every
piece of silver two; and besides that, thou wilt be able to enjoy the
amusements afforded by Egypt and its Nile.&mdash;The advice is judicious,
I replied: and accordingly I took the brokers with me to the Kh&aacute;n,
and they conveyed the stuffs to the &#7730;eys&aacute;reeyeh, where I sold it to
the merchants, writing a bond in their names, which I committed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
the money-changer, and taking from him a corresponding bond. I
then returned to the Kh&aacute;n, and remained there some days; and every
day I took for my breakfast a cup of wine, and had mutton and sweetmeats
prepared for me, until the month in which I became entitled to
the receipt of the profits, when I seated myself every Thursday and
Monday at the shops of the merchants, and the money-changer went
with the scrivener and brought me the money.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 466px; position: relative;"><a name="f114" id="f114"></a><img src="images/fig114.png" width="466" height="316" alt="Money-Changer and Scrivener, &amp;c." title="Money-Changer and Scrivener, &amp;c." /></div>

<p>Thus did I until one day I went to the bath and returned to the
Kh&aacute;n, and, entering my lodging, took for my breakfast a cup of wine,
and then slept; and when I awoke I ate a fowl,<a href="#V19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and perfumed myself
with essence, and repaired to the shop of a merchant named Bedr-ed-Deen
the Gardener,<a href="#V20" class="fnanchor">20</a> who, when he saw me, welcomed me, and conversed
with me a while in his shop; and as we were thus engaged, lo,
a female came and seated herself by my side. She wore a headkerchief
inclined on one side, and the odours of sweet perfumes were diffused
from her, and she captivated my reason by her beauty and loveliness
as she raised her iz&aacute;r and I beheld her black eyes. She saluted Bedr-ed-Deen,
and he returned her salutation, and stood conversing with
her; and when I heard her speech, love for her took entire possession
of my heart. She then said to Bedr-ed-Deen, Hast thou a piece of
stuff woven with pure gold thread? And he produced to her a piece;
and she said, May I take it and go, and then send thee the price?
But he answered, It is impossible, O my mistress; for this is the
owner of the stuff, and I owe him a portion of the profit.&mdash;Wo to
thee! said she: it is my custom to take of thee each piece of stuff for
a considerable sum of money, giving thee a gain beyond thy wish, and
then to send thee the price.&mdash;Yes, he rejoined; but I am in absolute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
want of the price this day. And upon this she took the piece and
threw it back to him upon his breast, saying, Verily your class knows
not how to respect any person's rank! And she arose, and turned
away. I felt then as if my soul went with her, and, rising upon my
feet, I said to her, O my mistress, kindly bestow a look upon me, and
retrace thine honoured steps. And she returned, and smiled and said,
For thy sake I return. And she sat opposite me upon the seat of
the shop; and I said to Bedr-ed-Deen, What is the price that thou
hast agreed to give for this piece. He answered, Eleven hundred
pieces of silver. And I said to him, Thy profit shall be a hundred
pieces of silver: give me then a paper, and I will write for thee the
price upon it. I then took the piece of stuff from him, and wrote him
the paper with my own hand, and gave the piece of stuff to the lady,
saying to her, Take it and go; and if thou wilt, bring the price to me
in the market; or, if thou wilt, it shall be my present to thee. She
replied, God recompense thee, and bless thee with my property, and
make thee my husband; and may God accept this prayer!&mdash;O my
mistress, said I, let this piece of stuff be thine, and another like it,
and permit me to see thy face. And upon this she raised her veil;
and when I beheld her face, the sight drew from me a thousand sighs,
and my heart was entangled by her love, so that I no longer remained
master of my reason. She then lowered the veil again, and took the
piece of stuff, saying, O my master, leave me not desolate. So she
departed, while I continued sitting in the market-street until past the
hour of afternoon-prayer, with wandering mind, overpowered by love.
In the excess of my passion, before I rose I asked the merchant respecting
her; and he answered me, She is a rich lady, the daughter of a
deceased Emeer, who left her great property.</p>

<p>I then took leave of him, and returned to the Kh&aacute;n, and the
supper was placed before me; but, reflecting upon her, I could eat
nothing. I laid myself down to rest; but sleep came not to me, and
I remained awake until the morning, when I arose and put on a suit
of clothing different from that which I had worn the day before; and,
having drunk a cup of wine, and eaten a few morsels as my breakfast,
repaired again to the shop of the merchant, and saluted him, and sat
down with him. The lady soon came, wearing a dress more rich than
the former, and attended by a slave-girl; and she seated herself, and
saluted me instead of Bedr-ed-Deen, and said, with an eloquent tongue
which I had never heard surpassed in softness or sweetness, Send with
me some one to receive the twelve hundred pieces of silver, the price<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
of the piece of stuff.&mdash;Wherefore, said I, this haste? She replied,
May we never lose thee! And she handed to me the price; and I sat
conversing with her, and made a sign to her, which she understood,
intimating my wish to visit her: whereupon she rose in haste,
expressing displeasure at my hint. My heart clung to her, and I
followed in the direction of her steps through the market-street; and
lo, a slave-girl came to me, and said, O my master, answer the summons
of my mistress. Wondering at this, I said, No one here knoweth me.&mdash;How
soon, she rejoined, hast thou forgotten her! My mistress is
she who was to-day at the shop of the merchant Bedr-ed-Deen.&mdash;So I
went with her until we arrived at the money-changer's;<a href="#V21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and when
her mistress, who was there, beheld me, she drew me to her side, and
said, O my beloved, thou hast wounded my heart, and love of thee
hath taken possession of it; and from the time that I first saw thee,
neither sleep nor food nor drink hath been pleasant to me. I replied,
And more than that do I feel; and the state in which I am needs no
complaint to testify it.&mdash;Then shall I visit thee, O my beloved, she
asked, or wilt thou come to me? For our marriage must be a secret.<a href="#V22" class="fnanchor">22</a>&mdash;I
am a stranger, I answered, and have no place of reception but the
Kh&aacute;n; therefore, if thou wilt kindly permit me to go to thine abode
the pleasure will be perfect.&mdash;Well, she replied; but to-night is the
eve of Friday, and let nothing be done till to-morrow, when, after thou
hast joined in the prayers, do thou mount thine ass, and inquire for
the &#7716;abb&aacute;neeyeh;<a href="#V23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and when thou hast arrived there, ask for the
house called the &#7730;&aacute;'ah<a href="#V24" class="fnanchor">24</a> of Barak&aacute;t the Na&#7731;eeb,<a href="#V25" class="fnanchor">25</a> known by the surname
of Aboo-Sh&aacute;meh; for there do I reside; and delay not; for I
shall be anxiously expecting thee.</p>

<p>On hearing this I rejoiced exceedingly, and we parted; and I
returned to the Kh&aacute;n in which I lodged. I passed the whole night
sleepless, and was scarcely sure that the daybreak had appeared when
I rose and changed my clothes, and, having perfumed myself with
essences and sweet scents, took with me fifty pieces of gold in a handkerchief,
and walked from the Kh&aacute;n of Mesroor to B&aacute;b Zuweyleh,<a href="#V26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
where I mounted an ass, and said to its owner, Go with me to the
&#7716;abb&aacute;neeyeh. And in less than the twinkling of an eye he set off,
and soon he stopped at a by-street called Darb El-Muna&#7731;&#7731;iree, when
I said to him, Enter the street, and inquire for the &#7730;&aacute;'ah of the
Na&#7731;eeb. He was absent but a little while, and, returning, said, Alight.&mdash;Walk
on before me, said I, to the &#7730;&aacute;'ah. And he went on until
he had led me to the house; whereupon I said to him, To-morrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
come to me hither to convey me back.&mdash;In the name of Allah, he
replied: and I handed to him a quarter of a piece of gold, and he took
it and departed. I then knocked at the door, and there came forth
to me two young virgins in whom the forms of womanhood had just
developed themselves, resembling two moons, and they said, Enter;
for our mistress is expecting thee, and she hath not slept last night
from her excessive love for thee. I entered an upper saloon with
seven doors: around it were latticed windows looking upon a garden
in which were fruits of every kind, and running streams and singing
birds: it was plastered with imperial gypsum, in which a man might
see his face reflected:<a href="#V27" class="fnanchor">27</a> its roof was ornamented with gilding, and surrounded
by inscriptions in letters of gold upon a ground of ultramarine:
it comprised a variety of beauties, and shone in the eyes of
beholders: the pavement was of coloured marbles, having in the midst
of it a fountain, with four snakes of red gold casting forth water from
their mouths like pearls and jewels at the corners of the pool;<a href="#V28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and it
was furnished with carpets of coloured silk, and mattresses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px; position: relative;"><a name="f115" id="f115"></a><img src="images/fig115.png" width="348" height="331" alt="Saloon" title="Saloon" /></div>

<p>Having entered, I seated myself; and scarcely had I done so when
the lady approached me. She wore a crown set with pearls and
jewels;<a href="#V29" class="fnanchor">29</a> her hands and feet were stained with &#7717;enn&agrave;; and her bosom
was ornamented with gold. As soon as she beheld me she smiled
in my face, and embraced me, saying, Is it true that thou hast come
to me, or is this a dream?&mdash;I am thy slave, I answered; and she said,
Thou art welcome. Verily, from the time when I first saw thee,
neither sleep hath been sweet to me, nor hath food been pleasant!&mdash;In
such case have <i>I</i> been, I replied;&mdash;and we sat down to converse;
but I hung down my head towards the ground, in bashfulness; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
not long had I thus remained when a repast was placed before me,
consisting of the most exquisite dishes, as fricandoes and hashes and
stuffed fowls. I ate with her until we were satisfied; when they
brought the basin and ewer, and I washed my hands; after which we
perfumed ourselves with rose-water infused with musk, and sat down
again to converse: expressing to each other our mutual passion; and
her love took such possession of me that all the wealth I possessed
seemed worthless in comparison. In this manner we continued to
enjoy ourselves until, night approaching, the female slaves brought
supper and wine, a complete service; and we drank until midnight.
Never in my life had I passed such a night. And when morning
came, I arose, and, having thrown to her the handkerchief containing
the pieces of gold,<a href="#V30" class="fnanchor">30</a> I took leave of her and went out; but as I did so
she wept, and said, O my master, when shall I see again this lovely
face? I answered her, I will be with thee at the commencement of
the night. And when I went forth, I found the owner of the ass, who
had brought me the day before, waiting for me at the door; and I
mounted, and returned with him to the Kh&aacute;n of Mesroor, where I
alighted, and gave to him half a piece of gold, saying to him, Come
hither at sunset. He replied, On the head be thy command.</p>

<p>I entered the Kh&aacute;n, and ate my breakfast, and then went forth to
collect the price of my stuffs; after which I returned. I had prepared
for my wife a roasted lamb, and purchased some sweetmeat and I
now called the porter, described to him the house, and gave him his
hire. Having done this, I occupied myself again with my business
until sunset, when the owner of the ass came, and I took fifty pieces
of gold, and put them into a handkerchief. Entering the house, I
found that they had wiped the marble and polished the vessels of
copper and brass, and filled the lamps and lighted the candles, and
dished the supper and strained the wine; and when my wife saw me,
she threw her arms around my neck, and said, Thou hast made me
desolate by thine absence! The tables were then placed before us,
and we ate until we were satisfied, and the slave-girls took away the
first table, and placed before us the wine; and we sat drinking, and
eating of the dried fruits, and making merry, until midnight. We
then slept until morning, when I arose and handed her the fifty pieces
of gold as before, and left her.</p>

<p>Thus I continued to do for a long time, until I passed the night and
awoke possessing not a piece of silver nor one of gold; and I said within
myself, This is the work of the Devil! And I repeated these verses:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poverty causeth the lustre of a man to grow dim, like the yellowness of the setting sun.</span>
<span class="i0">When absent, he is not remembered among mankind; and when present, he shareth not their pleasures.</span>
<span class="i0">In the market-streets he shunneth notice; and in desert places he poureth forth his tears.</span>
<span class="i0">By Allah! a man, among his own relations, when afflicted with poverty, is as a stranger!</span>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px; position: relative;"><a name="f116" id="f116"></a><img src="images/fig116.png" width="454" height="558" alt="Interior of B&aacute;b Zuweyleh (from a Sketch by M. Coste)" title="Interior of B&aacute;b Zuweyleh (from a Sketch by M. Coste)" /></div>

<p>With these reflections I walked forth into Beyn el-&#7730;a&#7779;reyn, and
proceeded thence to B&aacute;b Zuweyleh, where I found the people crowding
together, so that the gate was stopped up by their number; and, as
destiny willed, I saw there a trooper, and, unintentionally pressing
against him, my hand came in contact with his pocket, and I felt it,
and found that it contained a purse; and I caught hold of the purse,
and took it from his pocket. But the trooper felt that his pocket was
lightened, and, putting his hand into it, found nothing; upon which
he looked aside at me, and raised his hand with the mace,<a href="#V31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and struck
me upon my head. I fell to the ground, and the people surrounded
us, and seized the bridle of the trooper's horse, saying, On account of
the crowd dost thou strike this young man such a blow? But he
called out to them and said, This is a robber! On hearing this I
feared. The people around me said, This is a comely young man, and
hath taken nothing. While some, however, believed this, others disbelieved;
and after many words, the people dragged me along, desiring
to liberate me: but, as it was predestined, there came at this
moment the W&aacute;lee and other magistrates entering the gate, and, seeing
the people surrounding me and the trooper, the W&aacute;lee said, What is
the news? The trooper answered, By Allah, O Emeer, this is a robber:
I had in my pocket a blue purse containing twenty pieces of gold; and
he took it while I was pressed by the crowd.&mdash;Was any one with thee?
asked the W&aacute;lee. The trooper answered, No. And the W&aacute;lee called
out to the chief of his servants, saying, Seize him and search him.
So he seized me; and protection was withdrawn from me; and the
W&aacute;lee said to him, Strip him of all that is upon him. And when he
did so, they found the purse in my clothes: and the W&aacute;lee, taking
it, counted the money, and found it to be twenty pieces of gold, as the
trooper had said; whereupon he was enraged, and called out to his
attendants, saying, Bring him forward. They, therefore, brought me
before him, and he said to me, O young man, tell the truth. Didst
thou steal this purse?&mdash;And I hung down my head towards the ground,
saying within myself, If I answer that I did not steal it, it will be
useless, for he hath produced it from my clothes; and if I say, I stole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
it, I fall into trouble. I then raised my head, and said, Yes, I took
it. And when the W&aacute;lee heard these words, he wondered, and called
witnesses, who presented themselves, and gave their testimony to my
confession.&mdash;All this took place at B&aacute;b Zuweyleh.&mdash;The W&aacute;lee then
ordered the executioner to cut off my hand; and he cut off my right
hand;<a href="#V32" class="fnanchor">32</a> but the heart of the trooper was moved with compassion for
me, and he interceded for me that I should not be killed:<a href="#V33" class="fnanchor">33</a> so the
W&aacute;lee left me and departed. The people however continued around
me, and gave me to drink a cup of wine; and the trooper gave me the
purse, saying, Thou art a comely youth, and it is not fit that thou
shouldst be a thief. And I took it from him, and addressed him with
these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Allah! good sir, I was not a robber; nor was I a thief, O, best of mankind!</span>
<span class="i0">But fortune's vicissitudes overthrew me suddenly, and anxiety and trouble and poverty overpowered me.</span>
<span class="i0">I cast it not; but it was the Deity who cast an arrow that threw down the kingly diadem from my head.<a href="#V34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The trooper then left me and departed, after having given me the
purse, and I went my way; but first I wrapped my hand in a piece of
rag,<a href="#V35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and put it in my bosom. My condition thus altered, and my
countenance pallid in consequence of my sufferings, I walked to the
&#7730;&aacute;'ah, and, in a disordered state of mind, threw myself upon the bed.
My wife, seeing my complexion thus changed, said to me, What hath
pained thee, and wherefore do I see thee thus altered? I answered
her, My head acheth, and I am not well. And on hearing this she
was vexed, and became ill on my account, and said, Burn not my heart,
O my master! Sit up, and raise thy head, and tell me what hath
happened to thee this day; for I read a tale in thy face.&mdash;Abstain from
speaking to me, I replied. And she wept, and said, It seemeth that
thou art tired of us; for I see thee to be conducting thyself in a
manner contrary to thy usual habit. Then she wept again, and continued
addressing me, though I made her no reply, until the approach
of night, when she placed some food before me; but I abstained from
it, fearing that she should see me eat with my left hand, and said, I
have no desire to eat at present. She then said again, Tell me what
hath happened to thee this day, and wherefore I see thee anxious and
broken-hearted. I answered, I will presently tell thee at my leisure.
And she put the wine towards me, saying, Take it; for it will dispel
thine anxiety; and thou must drink, and tell me thy story. I replied,
therefore, If it must be so, give me to drink with thy hand. And she
filled a cup and drank it; and then filled it again and handed it to
me, and I took it from her with my left hand, and, while tears ran
from my eyes, I repeated these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When God willeth an event to befall a man who is endowed with reason and hearing and sight,</span>
<span class="i0">He deafeneth his ears, and blindeth his heart, and draweth his reason from him as a hair.<a href="#V36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span>
<span class="i0">Till, having fulfilled his purpose against him, He restoreth him his reason that he may be admonished.<a href="#V37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having thus said, I wept again; and when she saw me do so, she
uttered a loud cry, and said, What is the reason of thy weeping?
Thou hast burned my heart! And wherefore didst thou take the cup
with thy left hand?&mdash;I answered her, I have a boil upon my right
hand.&mdash;Then put it forth, said she, that I may open it for thee.&mdash;It is
not yet, I replied, the proper time for opening it; and continue not to
ask me; for I will not put it forth at present. I then drank the contents
of the cup, and she continued to hand me the wine until intoxi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>cation
overcame me, and I fell asleep in the place where I was sitting;
upon which she discovered that my right arm was without a hand,
and, searching me, saw the purse containing the gold.</p>

<p>Grief, such as none else experienceth, overcame her at the sight;
and she suffered incessant torment on my account until the morning,
when I awoke, and found that she had prepared for me a dish composed
of four boiled fowls, which she placed before me. She then gave me
to drink a cup of wine; and I ate and drank, and put down the purse,
and was about to depart; but she said, Whither wouldst thou go? I
answered, To such a place, to dispel somewhat of the anxiety which
oppresseth my heart.&mdash;Go not, said she; but rather sit down again.
So I sat down, and she said to me, Hath thy love of me become so
excessive that thou hast expended all thy wealth upon me, and lost thy
hand? I take thee, then, as witness against me, and God also is
witness, that I will never desert thee; and thou shalt see the truth of
my words.&mdash;Immediately, therefore, she sent for witnesses, who came;
and she said to them, Write my contract of marriage to this young
man, and bear witness that I have received the dowry. And they did
as she desired them; after which she said, Bear witness that all my
property which is in this chest, and all my memlooks and female
slaves, belong to this young man. Accordingly, they declared themselves
witnesses of her declaration, and I accepted the property, and
they departed after they had received their fees. She then took me
by my hand, and, having led me to a closet, opened a large chest, and
said to me, See what is contained in this chest. I looked, therefore;
and lo, it was full of handkerchiefs; and she said, This is thy property;
which I have received from thee: for every time that thou gavest me
a handkerchief containing fifty pieces of gold, I wrapped it up, and
threw it into this chest: take, then, thy property; for God hath
restored it to thee, and thou art now of high estate. Fate hath
afflicted thee on my account so that thou hast lost thy right hand, and
I am unable to compensate thee: if I should sacrifice my life, it would
be but a small thing, and thy generosity would still have surpassed
mine.&mdash;She then added, Now take possession of thy property. So I
received it; and she transferred the contents of her chest to mine,
adding her property to mine which I had given her. My heart rejoiced,
my anxiety ceased, and I approached and kissed her, and made myself
merry by drinking with her; after which she said again, Thou hast
sacrificed all thy wealth and thy hand through love of me, and how
can I compensate thee? By Allah, if I gave my life for love of thee,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
it were but a small thing, and I should not do justice to thy claims
upon me.&mdash;She then wrote a deed of gift transferring to me all her
apparel, and her ornaments of gold and jewels, and her houses and
other possessions; and she passed that night in grief on my account,
having heard my relation of the accident that had befallen me.</p>

<p>Thus we remained less than a month, during which time she
became more and more infirm and disordered; and she endured no
more than fifty days before she was numbered among the people of
the other world. So I prepared her funeral, and deposited her body
in the earth, and having caused recitations of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n to be performed
for her, and given a considerable sum of money in alms for her
sake, returned from the tomb. I found that she had possessed abundant
wealth, and houses and lands, and among her property were the
store-rooms of sesame of which I sold to thee the contents of one;
and I was not prevented from settling with thee during this period
but by my being busied in selling the remainder, the price of which I
have not yet entirely received. Now I desire of thee that thou wilt not
oppose me in that which I am about to say to thee; since I have eaten
of thy food: I give thee the price of the sesame, which is in thy hands.&mdash;This
which I have told thee was the cause of my eating with my
left hand.</p>

<p>I replied, Thou hast treated me with kindness and generosity:&mdash;and
he then said, Thou must travel with me to my country; for I
have bought merchandise of Cairo and Alexandria. Wilt thou accompany
me?&mdash;I answered, Yes;&mdash;and promised him that I would be
ready by the first day of the following month. So I sold all that I
possessed, and, having bought merchandise with the produce, travelled
with the young man to this thy country, where he sold his merchandise
and bought other in its stead, after which he returned to the land of
Egypt: but it was my lot to remain here, and to experience that
which hath befallen me this night during my absence from my native
country.&mdash;Now is not this, O King of the age, more wonderful than
the story of the humpback?</p>

<p>The King replied, Ye must be hanged, all of you!&mdash;And upon
this, the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n's steward advanced towards the King, and said, If
thou permit me, I will relate to thee a story that I happened to hear
just before I found this humpback; and if it be more wonderful than
the events relating to him, wilt thou grant us our lives?&mdash;The King
answered, Tell thy story:&mdash;and he began thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY TOLD BY THE SUL&#7788;&Aacute;N'S STEWARD.</h5>

<p>I was last night with a party who celebrated a recitation of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n,<a href="#V38" class="fnanchor">38</a> for which purpose they had assembled the professors of religion
and law; and when these reciters had accomplished their task,
the servants spread a repast, comprising among other dishes a zirb&aacute;jeh.<a href="#V39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
We approached, therefore, to eat of the zirb&aacute;jeh; but one of the company
drew back, and refused to partake of it: we conjured him; yet
he swore that he would not eat of it: and we pressed him again; but
he said, Press me not; for I have suffered enough from eating of this
dish. And when we had finished, we said to him, By Allah, tell us
the reason of thine abstaining from eating of this zirb&aacute;jeh. He
replied, Because I cannot eat of it unless I wash my hands forty times
with kali, and forty times with cyperus, and forty times with soap;
altogether, a hundred and twenty times. And upon this, the giver of
the entertainment ordered his servants, and they brought water and
the other things which this man required: so he washed his hands as
he had described, and advanced, though with disgust, and, having
seated himself, stretched forth his hand as one in fear, and put it into
the zirb&aacute;jeh, and began to eat, while we regarded him with the utmost
wonder. His hand trembled, and when he put it forth, we saw that
his thumb was cut off, and that he ate with his four fingers: we therefore
said to him, We conjure thee, by Allah, to tell us how was thy
thumb maimed: was it thus created by God, or hath some accident
happened to it?&mdash;O my brothers, he answered, not only have I lost
this thumb, but also the thumb of the other hand; and each of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
feet is in like manner deprived of the great toe: but see ye:&mdash;and, so
saying, he uncovered the stump of the thumb of his other hand, and
we found it like the right; and so also his feet, destitute of the great
toes. At the sight of this, our wonder increased, and we said to him,
We are impatient to hear thy story, and thine account of the cause of
the amputation of thy thumbs and great toes, and the reason of thy
washing thy hands a hundred and twenty times. So he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>Know that my father was a great merchant, the chief of the merchants
of the city of Baghd&aacute;d in the time of the Khaleefeh H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed;
but he was ardently addicted to the drinking of wine, and
hearing the lute; and when he died, he left nothing. I buried him,
and caused recitations of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n to be performed for him, and,
after I had mourned for him days and nights, I opened his shop, and
found that he had left in it but few goods, and that his debts were
many: however, I induced his creditors to wait, and calmed their
minds, and betook myself to selling and buying from week to week,
and so paying the creditors.<a href="#V40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Thus I continued to do for a considerable period, until I had discharged
all the debts and increased my capital; and as I was sitting
one day, I beheld a young lady, than whom my eye had never beheld
any more beautiful, decked with magnificent ornaments and apparel,
riding on a mule, with a slave before her and a slave behind her; and
she stopped the mule at the entrance of the market-street, and entered,
followed by a eunuch, who said to her, O my mistress, enter, but
inform no one who thou art, lest thou open the fire of indignation
upon us. The eunuch then further cautioned her; and when she
looked at the shops of the merchants, she found none more handsome
than mine; so, when she arrived before me, with the eunuch following
her, she sat down upon the seat of my shop, and saluted me; and I
never heard speech more charming than hers, or words more sweet,
She then drew aside the veil from her face, and I directed at her a
glance which drew from me a sigh; my heart was captivated by her love,
and I continued repeatedly gazing at her face, and recited these two
verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Say to the beauty in the dove-coloured veil, Death would indeed be welcome to relieve me from thy torment.</span>
<span class="i0">Favour me with a visit, that so I may live. See, I stretch forth my hand to accept thy liberality.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when she had heard my recitation of them, she answered thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">May I lose my heart if it cease to love you! For verily my heart loveth none but you.</span>
<span class="i0">If my eye regard any charms but yours, may the sight of you never rejoice it after absence!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>She then said to me, O youth, hast thou any handsome stuffs?&mdash;O my
mistress, I answered, thy slave is a poor man; but wait until the other
merchants open their shops, and then I will bring thee what thou
desirest. So I conversed with her, drowned in the sea of her love, and
bewildered by my passion for her, until the merchants had opened
their shops, when I arose, and procured all that she wanted, and the
price of these stuffs was five thousand pieces of silver: and she handed
them all to the eunuch, who took them; after which, they both went
out from the market-street, and the slaves brought to her the mule,
and she mounted, without telling me whence she was, and I was
ashamed to mention the subject to her: consequently, I became
answerable for the price to the merchants, incurring a debt of five
thousand pieces of silver.</p>

<p>I went home, intoxicated with her love, and they placed before me
the supper, and I ate a morsel; but reflections upon her beauty and
loveliness prevented my eating more. I desired to sleep, but sleep
came not to me; and in this condition I remained for a week. The
merchants demanded of me their money; but I prevailed upon them
to wait another week; and after this week, the lady came again, riding
upon a mule, and attended by a eunuch and two other slaves; and,
having saluted me, said, O my master, we have been tardy in bringing
to thee the price of the stuffs: bring now the money-changer, and
receive it.<a href="#V41" class="fnanchor">41</a> So the money-changer came, and the eunuch gave him
the money, and I took it, and sat conversing with her until the market
was replenished, and the merchants opened their shops, when she said
to me, Procure for me such and such things. Accordingly, I procured
for her what she desired of the merchants, and she took the goods and
departed without saying anything to me respecting the price. When
she had gone, therefore, I repented of what I had done; for I had
procured for her what she demanded for the price of a thousand pieces
of gold; and as soon as she had disappeared from my sight, I said
within myself, What kind of love is this? She hath brought me five
thousand pieces of silver, and taken goods for a thousand pieces of
gold!&mdash;I feared that the result would be my bankruptcy, and the loss
of the property of others, and said, The merchants know none but me,
and this woman is no other than a cheat, who hath imposed upon me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
by her beauty and loveliness: seeing me to be young, she hath laughed
at me, and I asked her not where was her residence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px; position: relative;"><a name="f118" id="f118"></a><img src="images/fig118.png" width="590" height="469" alt="Arrival of the Lady on the Mule" title="Arrival of the Lady on the Mule" /></div>

<p>I remained in a state of perplexity, and her absence was prolonged
more than a month. Meanwhile the merchants demanded of me their
money, and so pressed me that I offered my possessions for sale, and
was on the brink of ruin; but as I was sitting absorbed in reflection,
suddenly she alighted at the gate of the market-street, and came in to
me. As soon as I beheld her, my solicitude ceased, and I forgot the
trouble which I had suffered. She approached, and addressed me
with her agreeable conversation, and said, Produce the scales, and
weigh thy money:&mdash;and she gave me the price of the goods which she
had taken, with a surplus; after which, she amused herself by talking
with me, and I almost died with joy and happiness. She then said
to me, Hast thou a wife? I answered, No: for I am not acquainted
with any woman:&mdash;and wept. So she asked me, What causeth thee
to weep? And I answered, A thought that hath come into my mind:&mdash;and,
taking some pieces of gold, gave them to the eunuch, requesting
him to grant me his mediation in the affair; upon which he
laughed, and said, She is in love with thee more than thou art with
her, and hath no want of the stuffs, but hath done this only from her
love of thee: propose to her, therefore, what thou wilt; for she will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
not oppose thee in that which thou wilt say. Now she observed me
giving the pieces of gold to the eunuch, and returned, and resumed
her seat; and I said to her, Shew favour to thy slave, and pardon me
for that which I am about to say. I then acquainted her with the
feelings of my heart, and my declaration pleased her, and she consented
to my proposal, saying, This eunuch will come with my letter; and do
thou what he shall tell thee;&mdash;and she arose, and departed.</p>

<p>I went to the merchants, and delivered to them their money, and
all profited except myself; for when she left me I mourned for the
interruption of our intercourse, and I slept not during the whole of the
next night: but a few days after, her eunuch came to me, and I received
him with honour, and asked him respecting his mistress. He
answered, She is sick:&mdash;and I said to him, Disclose to me her history.
He replied, The lady Zubeydeh, the wife of H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed, brought
up this damsel, and she is one of her slaves: she had desired of her
mistress to be allowed the liberty of going out and returning at pleasure,
and the latter gave her permission: she continued, therefore, to
do so until she became a chief confident; after which, she spoke of
thee to her mistress, and begged that she would marry her to thee:
but her mistress said, I will not do it until I see this young man, and
if he have a desire for thee, I will marry thee to him. We therefore
wish to introduce thee immediately into the palace; and if thou enter
without any one's having knowledge of thy presence, thou wilt succeed
in accomplishing thy marriage with her; but if thy plot be discovered,
thy head will be struck off. What, then, sayest thou?&mdash;I answered,
Good: I will go with thee, and await the event that shall befall me
there.&mdash;As soon, then, as this next night shall have closed in, said the
eunuch, repair to the mosque which the lady Zubeydeh hath built on
the bank of the Tigris, and there say thy prayers, and pass the night.<a href="#V42" class="fnanchor">42</a>&mdash;Most
willingly, I replied.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the time of nightfall arrived, I went to the
mosque, and said my prayers there, and passed the night; and as soon
as the morning began to dawn, I saw two eunuchs approaching in a
small boat, conveying some empty chests, which they brought into the
mosque. One of them then departed, and the other remained; and I
looked attentively at him, and lo, it was he who had been our intermediary:
and soon after, the damsel, my companion, came up to us.
I rose to her when she approached, and embraced her; and she kissed
me, and wept: and after we had conversed together for a little while,
she took me and placed me in a chest, and locked it upon me.<a href="#V43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The
slaves then brought a quantity of stuffs, and filled with them the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
chests, which they locked, and conveyed, together with the chest in
which I was enclosed, to the boat, accompanied by the damsel; and
having embarked them, they plied the oars, and proceeded to the palace
of the honoured lady Zubeydeh. The intoxication of love now ceased
in me, and reflection came in its place: I repented of what I had done,
and prayed God to deliver me from my dangerous predicament.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px; position: relative;"><a name="f119" id="f119"></a><img src="images/fig119.png" width="506" height="273" alt="Mosque on the Bank of the Tigris" title="Mosque on the Bank of the Tigris" /></div>

<p>Meanwhile, they arrived at the gate of the Khaleefeh, where they
landed, and took out all the chests, and conveyed them into the
palace: but the chief of the door-keepers, who had been asleep when
they arrived, was awoke by the sounds of their voices, and cried out to
the damsel, saying, The chests must be opened, that I may see what
is in them:&mdash;and he arose, and placed his hand upon the chest in
which I was hidden. My reason abandoned me, my heart almost
burst from my body, and my limbs trembled; but the damsel said,
These are the chests of the lady Zubeydeh, and if thou open them and
turn them over, she will be incensed against thee, and we shall all
perish. They contain nothing but clothes dyed of various colours,
except this chest upon which thou hast put thy hand, in which there
are also some bottles filled with the water of Zemzem,<a href="#V44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and if any
of the water run out upon the clothes it will spoil their colours. Now
I have advised thee, and it is for thee to decide: so do what thou wilt.&mdash;When
he heard, therefore, these words, he said to her, Take the
chests, and pass on:&mdash;and the eunuchs immediately took them up,
and, with the damsel, conveyed them into the palace: but in an instant,
I heard a person crying out, and saying, The Khaleefeh! The
Khaleefeh!</p>

<p>I was bereft of my reason, and seized with a colick from excessive
fear; I almost died, and my limbs were affected with a violent shaking.
The Khaleefeh cried out to the damsel, saying to her, What are these
chests? She answered, O my lord (may God exalt thy dominion!),
these chests contain clothes of my mistress Zubeydeh.&mdash;Open them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
said the Khaleefeh, that I may see the clothes.&mdash;When I heard this,
I felt sure of my destruction. The damsel could not disobey his
command; but she replied, O Prince of the Faithful, there is nothing
in these chests but clothes of the lady Zubeydeh, and she hath commanded
me not to open them to any one. The Khaleefeh, however,
said, The chests must be opened, all of them, that I may see their
contents:&mdash;and immediately he called out to the eunuchs to bring them
before him. I therefore felt certain that I was on the point of destruction.
They then brought before him chest after chest, and opened
each to him, and he examined the contents; and when they brought
forward the chest in which I was enclosed, I bade adieu to life, and
prepared myself for death; but as the eunuchs were about to open it,
the damsel said, O Prince of the Faithful, verily this chest containeth
things especially appertaining to women; and it is proper, therefore,
that it should be opened before the lady Zubeydeh:&mdash;and when the
Khaleefeh heard her words, he ordered the eunuchs to convey all the
chests into the interior of the palace. The damsel then hastened, and
ordered two eunuchs to carry away the chest in which I was hidden,
and they took it to an inner chamber, and went their way: whereupon
she quickly opened it, and made a sign to me to come out: so I did
as she desired, and entered a closet that was before me, and she locked
the door upon me, and closed the chest: and when the eunuchs had
brought in all the chests, and had gone back, she opened the door of
the closet, and said, Thou hast nothing to fear! May God refresh
thine eye! Come forth now, and go up with me, that thou mayest
have the happiness of kissing the ground before the lady Zubeydeh.</p>

<p>I therefore went with her, and beheld twenty other female slaves,
high-bosomed virgins, and among them was the lady Zubeydeh, who
was scarcely able to walk from the weight of the robes and ornaments
with which she was decked. As she approached, the female slaves
dispersed from around her, and I advanced to her, and kissed the
ground before her. She made a sign to me to sit down: so I seated
myself before her; and she began to ask me questions respecting my
condition and lineage; to all of which I gave such answers that she
was pleased, and said, By Allah, the care which we have bestowed on
the education of this damsel hath not been in vain. She then said to
me, Know that this damsel is esteemed by us as though she were really
our child, and she is a trust committed to thy care by God. Upon
this, therefore, I again kissed the ground before her, well pleased to
marry the damsel; after which, she commanded me to remain with
them ten days. Accordingly, I continued with them during this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
period; but I knew nothing meanwhile of the damsel; certain of the
maids only bringing me my dinner and supper, as my servants. After
this, however, the lady Zubeydeh asked permission of her husband, the
Prince of the Faithful, to marry her maid, and he granted her request,
and ordered that ten thousand pieces of gold should be given to her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px; position: relative;"><a name="f120" id="f120"></a><img src="images/fig120.png" width="475" height="417" alt="Displaying of the Bride" title="Displaying of the Bride" /></div>

<p>The lady Zubeydeh, therefore, sent for the &#7730;&aacute;&#7697;ee and witnesses,
and they wrote my contract of marriage to the damsel; and the maids
then prepared sweetmeats and exquisite dishes, and distributed them
in all the apartments. Thus they continued to do for a period of ten
more days; and after the twenty days had passed, they conducted the
damsel into the bath, preparatively to my being introduced to her as
her husband. They then brought to me a repast comprising a basin
of zirb&aacute;jeh sweetened with sugar, perfumed with rose-water infused
with musk, and containing different kinds of fricandoed fowls and a
variety of other ingredients, such as astonished the mind; and, by Allah,
when this repast was brought, I instantly commenced upon the
zirb&aacute;jeh, and ate of it as much as satisfied me, and wiped my hand,
but forgot to wash it. I remained sitting until it became dark; when
the maids lighted the candles, and the singing-girls approached with
the tambourines, and they continued to display the bride, and to give
presents of gold, until she had perambulated the whole of the palace;
after which, they brought her to me, and disrobed her; and as soon
as I was left alone with her, I threw my arms around her neck,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
scarcely believing in our union: but as I did so, she perceived the
smell of the zirb&aacute;jeh from my hand, and immediately uttered a loud
cry: whereupon the female slaves ran in to her from every quarter.</p>

<p>I was violently agitated, not knowing what was the matter; and
the slaves who had come in said to her, What hath happened to thee,
O our sister?&mdash;Take away from me, she exclaimed to them, this madman,
whom I imagined to be a man of sense!&mdash;What indication of my
insanity hath appeared to thee? I asked. Thou madman, said she,
wherefore hast thou eaten of the zirb&aacute;jeh, and not washed thy hand?
By Allah, I will not accept thee for thy want of sense, and thy disgusting
conduct!&mdash;And so saying, she took from her side a whip,<a href="#V45" class="fnanchor">45</a> and
beat me with it upon my back until I became insensible from the
number of the stripes. She then said to the other maids, Take him
to the magistrate of the city police, that he may cut off his hand with
which he ate the zirb&aacute;jeh without washing it afterwards. On hearing
this, I exclaimed, There is no strength nor power but in God! Wilt
thou cut off my hand on account of my eating a zirb&aacute;jeh and neglecting
to wash it?&mdash;And the maids who were present entreated her,
saying to her, O our sister, be not angry with him for what he hath
done this time. But she replied, By Allah, I must cut off something
from his extremities! And immediately she departed, and was absent
from me ten days: after which, she came again, and said to me, O
thou black-faced! Am I not worthy of thee? How didst thou dare
to eat the zirb&aacute;jeh and not wash thy hand?&mdash;And she called to the
maids, who bound my hands behind me, and she took a sharp razor,
and cut off both my thumbs and both my great toes, as ye see, O companions;
and I swooned away. She then sprinkled upon my wounds
some powder, by means of which the blood was stanched; and I said,
I will not eat of a zirb&aacute;jeh as long as I live unless I wash my hands
forty times with kali and forty times with cyperus and forty times with
soap:&mdash;and she exacted of me an oath that I would not eat of this dish
unless I washed my hands as I have described to you. Therefore,
when this zirb&aacute;jeh was brought, my colour changed, and I said within
myself, This was the cause of the cutting off of my thumbs and great
toes:&mdash;so, when ye compelled me, I said, I must fulfil the oath which
I have sworn.</p>

<p>I then said to him (continued the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n's steward), And what
happened to thee after that? He answered, When I had thus sworn
to her, she was appeased, and I was admitted into her favour; and we
lived happily together for a considerable time: after which she said,
The people of the Khaleefeh's palace know not that thou hast resided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
here with me, and no strange man beside thee hath entered it; nor
didst thou enter but through the assistance of the lady Zubeydeh.
She then gave me fifty thousand pieces of gold, and said to me, Take
these pieces of gold, and go forth and buy for us a spacious house.
So I went forth, and purchased a handsome and spacious house, and
removed thither all the riches that she possessed, and all that she had
treasured up, and her dresses and rarities.&mdash;This was the cause of the
amputation of my thumbs and great toes.&mdash;So we ate (said the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n's
steward), and departed; and after this, the accident with the humpback
happened to me: this is all my story; and peace be on thee.</p>

<p>The King said, This is not more pleasant than the story of the
humpback: nay, the story of the humpback is more pleasant than
this; and ye must all of you be crucified.&mdash;The Jew, however, then
came forward, and, having kissed the ground, said, O King of the age,
I will relate to thee a story more wonderful than that of the humpback:&mdash;and
the King said, Relate thy story. So he commenced
thus:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY TOLD BY THE JEWISH PHYSICIAN.</h5>

<p>The most wonderful of the events that happened to me in my
younger days was this:&mdash;I was residing in Damascus, where I learnt
and practised my art; and while I was thus occupied, one day there
came to me a memlook from the house of the governor of the city: so
I went forth with him, and accompanied him to the abode of the
governor. I entered, and beheld, at the upper end of a saloon, a couch
of alabaster overlaid with plates of gold, upon which was reclining a
sick man: he was young; and a person more comely had not been
seen in his age. Seating myself at his head, I ejaculated a prayer for
his restoration;<a href="#V46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and he made a sign to me with his eye. I then
said to him, O my master, stretch forth to me thy hand:&mdash;whereupon
he put forth to me his left hand; and I was surprised at this, and
said within myself, What self-conceit! I felt his pulse, however,
and wrote a prescription for him, and continued to visit him
for a period of ten days, until he recovered his strength; when he
entered the bath, and washed himself, and came forth: and the
governor conferred upon me a handsome dress of honour, and
appointed me superintendent of the hospital of Damascus.<a href="#V47" class="fnanchor">47</a> But
when I went with him into the bath, which they had cleared of all
other visitors for us alone, and the servants had brought the clothes,
and taken away those which he had pulled off within, I perceived that
his right hand had been cruelly amputated; at the sight of which I
wondered, and grieved for him; and looking at his skin, I observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
upon him marks of beating with mi&#7731;ra'ahs, which caused me to
wonder more. The young man then turned towards me, and said, O
doctor of the age, wonder not at my case; for I will relate to thee my
story when we have gone out from the bath:&mdash;and when we had gone
forth, and arrived at the house, and had eaten some food, and rested,
he said to me, Hast thou a desire to divert thyself in the supper-room?
I answered, Yes:&mdash;and immediately he ordered the slaves to take up
thither the furniture, and to roast a lamb and bring us some fruit.
So the slaves did as he commanded them: and when they had brought
the fruit, and we had eaten, I said to him, Relate to me thy story:&mdash;and
he replied, O doctor of the age, listen to the relation of the events
which have befallen me.</p>

<p>Know that I am of the children of El-M&oacute;&#7779;il. My paternal grandfather
died leaving ten male children, one of whom was my father: he
was the eldest of them; and they all grew up and married; and my
father was blest with me; but none of his nine brothers was blest
with children. So I grew up among my uncles, who delighted in me
exceedingly; and when I had attained to manhood, I was one day with
my father in the chief mosque of El-M&oacute;&#7779;il. The day was Friday;
and we performed the congregational prayers, and all the people went
out, except my father and my uncles, who sat conversing together
respecting the wonders of various countries, and the strange sights of
different cities, until they mentioned Egypt; when one of my uncles
said, The travellers assert, that there is not on the face of the earth a
more agreeable country than Egypt with its Nile:<a href="#V48" class="fnanchor">48</a>&mdash;and my father
added, He who hath not seen Cairo hath not seen the world: its soil
is gold; its Nile is a wonder; its women are like the black-eyed virgins
of Paradise; its houses are palaces; and its air is temperate; its odour
surpassing that of aloes-wood, and cheering the heart: and how can
Cairo be otherwise when it is the metropolis of the world?<a href="#V49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Did ye
see its gardens in the evening (he continued), with the shade obliquely
extending over them, ye would behold a wonder, and yield with ecstasy
to their attractions.<a href="#V50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>When I heard these descriptions of Egypt, my mind became wholly
engaged by reflections upon that country; and after they had departed
to their homes, I passed the night sleepless from my excessive longing
towards it, and neither food nor drink was pleasant to me. A few days
after, my uncles prepared to journey thither, and I wept before my
father that I might go with them, so that he prepared a stock of merchandise
for me, and I departed in their company; but he said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
them, Suffer him not to enter Egypt, but leave him at Damascus, that
he may there sell his merchandise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px; position: relative;"><a name="f123" id="f123"></a><img src="images/fig123.png" width="575" height="420" alt="Aleppo" title="Aleppo" /></div>

<p>I took leave of my father, and we set forth from El-M&oacute;&#7779;il, and
continued our journey until we arrived at Aleppo, where we remained
some days; after which we proceeded thence until we came to Damascus;
and we beheld it to be a city with trees and rivers and fruits and
birds, as though it were a paradise, containing fruits of every kind.
We took lodgings in one of the Kh&aacute;ns, and my uncles remained there
until they had sold and bought; and they also sold my merchandise,
gaining, for every piece of silver, five, so that I rejoiced at my profit.
My uncles then left me, and repaired to Egypt, and I remained, and
took up my abode in a handsome &#7730;&aacute;'ah, such as the tongue cannot
describe; the monthly rent of which was two pieces of gold.<a href="#V51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Here I indulged myself with eating and drinking, squandering
away the money that was in my possession; and as I was sitting one
day at the door of the &#7730;&aacute;'ah, a damsel approached me, attired in
clothing of the richest description, such as I had never seen surpassed
in costliness, and I invited her to come in; whereupon, without hesitation,
she entered; and I was delighted at her compliance, and closed
the door upon us both. She then uncovered her face, and took off her
iz&aacute;r, and I found her to be so surprisingly beautiful that love for her
took possession of my heart: so I went and brought a repast consisting
of the most delicious viands and fruit and everything else that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
requisite for her entertainment, and we ate and sported together; after
which, we drank till we were intoxicated, and fell asleep, and so we
remained until the morning, when I handed her ten pieces of gold;
but she swore that she would not accept them from me, and said,
Expect me again, O my beloved, after three days: at the hour of sunset
I will be with thee: and do thou prepare for us, with these pieces of
gold, a repast similar to this which we have just enjoyed. She then
gave me ten pieces of gold, and took leave of me, and departed, taking
my reason with her. And after the three days had expired, she came
again, decked with embroidered stuffs and ornaments and other attire
more magnificent than those which she wore on the former occasion.
I had prepared for her what was required previously to her arrival; so
we now ate and drank and fell asleep as before; and in the morning
she gave me again ten pieces of gold, promising to return to me after
three more days. I therefore made ready what was requisite, and
after the three days she came attired in a dress still more magnificent
than the first and second, and said to me, O my master, am I beautiful?&mdash;Yea,
verily, I answered.&mdash;Wilt thou give me leave, she rejoined,
to bring with me a damsel more beautiful than myself, and younger
than I, that she may sport with us, and we may make merry with
her? For she hath requested that she may accompany me, and pass
the night in frolicking with us.&mdash;And so saying, she gave me twenty
pieces of gold, desiring me to prepare a more plentiful repast, on
account of the lady who was to come with her; after which, she bade
me farewell, and departed.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the fourth day, I procured what was requisite, as
usual, and soon after sunset she came, accompanied by a female
wrapped in an iz&aacute;r, and they entered, and seated themselves. I was
rejoiced, and I lighted the candles, and welcomed them with joy and
exultation. They then took off their outer garments, and when the
new damsel uncovered her face, I perceived that she was like the full
moon: I had never beheld a person more beautiful. I arose immediately,
and placed before them the food and drink, and we ate and
drank, while I continued caressing the new damsel, and filling the
wine-cup for her, and drinking with her: but the first lady was
affected with a secret jealousy.&mdash;By Allah, she said, verily this girl is
beautiful! Is she not more charming than I?&mdash;Yea, indeed, I
answered.&mdash;Soon after this, I fell asleep, and when I awoke in the
morning, I found my hand defiled with blood, and, opening my eyes,
perceived that the sun had risen; so I attempted to rouse the damsel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
my new companion, whereupon her head rolled from her body. The
other damsel was gone, and I concluded, therefore, that she had done
this from her jealousy; and after reflecting a while, I arose, and took
off my clothes, and dug a hole in the &#7730;&aacute;'ah, in which I deposited the
murdered damsel, afterwards covering her remains with earth, and
replacing the marble pavement as it was before. I then dressed
myself again, and, taking the remainder of my money, went forth, and
repaired to the owner of the &#7730;&aacute;'ah, and paid him a year's rent, saying
to him, I am about to journey to my uncles in Egypt.</p>

<p>So I departed to Egypt, where I met with my uncles, and they
were rejoiced to see me. I found that they had concluded the sale
of their merchandise, and they said to me, What is the cause of thy
coming? I answered, I had a longing desire to be with you, and feared
that my money would not suffice me.&mdash;For a year I remained with
them, enjoying the pleasures of Egypt and its Nile; and I dipped my
hand into the residue of my money, and expended it prodigally in
eating and drinking until near the time of my uncles' departure, when
I fled from them: so they said, Probably, he hath gone before us, and
returned to Damascus:&mdash;and they departed. I then came forth from
my concealment, and remained in Cairo three years, squandering away
my money until scarcely any of it remained: but meanwhile I sent
every year the rent of the &#7730;&aacute;'ah at Damascus to its owner: and after
the three years my heart became contracted, for nothing remained in
my possession but the rent for the year.</p>

<p>I therefore journeyed back to Damascus, and alighted at the &#7730;&aacute;'ah.
The owner was rejoiced to see me, and I entered it, and cleansed it of
the blood of the murdered damsel, and, removing a cushion, I found,
beneath this, the necklace that she had worn that night. I took it up
and examined it, and wept a while. After this I remained in the
house two days, and on the third day I entered the bath, and changed
my clothes. I now had no money left; and I went one day to the
market, where (the Devil suggesting it to me, in order to accomplish
the purpose of destiny) I handed the necklace of jewels to a broker;
and he rose to me, and seated me by his side: then having waited
until the market was replenished, he took it, and announced it for sale
secretly, without my knowledge. The price bidden for it amounted to
two thousand pieces of gold; but he came to me and said, This necklace
is of brass, of the counterfeit manufacture of the Franks, and its
price hath amounted to a thousand pieces of silver. I answered him,
Yes; we had made it for a woman, merely to laugh at her, and my wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
has inherited it, and we desire to sell it: go, therefore, and receive the
thousand pieces of silver. Now when the broker heard this, he perceived
that the affair was suspicious, and went and gave the necklace
to the chief of the market, who took it to the W&aacute;lee, and said to him,
This necklace was stolen from me, and we have found the thief, clad
in the dress of the sons of the merchants. And before I knew what
had happened, the officers had surrounded me, and they took me to
the W&aacute;lee, who questioned me respecting the necklace. I told him,
therefore, the same story that I had told to the broker; but he laughed,
and said, This is not the truth:&mdash;and instantly his people stripped me
of my outer clothing, and beat me with mi&#7731;ra'ahs all over my body,
until, through the torture that I suffered from the blows, I said, I
stole it;&mdash;reflecting that it was better I should say I stole it, than
confess that its owner was murdered in my abode; for then they would
kill me to avenge her: and as soon as I had said so, they cut off my
hand, and scalded the stump with boiling oil,<a href="#V52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and I swooned away.
They then gave me to drink some wine, by swallowing which I recovered
my senses; and I took my amputated hand, and returned to the
&#7730;&aacute;'ah; but its owner said to me, Since this hath happened to thee,
leave the &#7730;&aacute;'ah, and look for another abode; for thou art accused of
an unlawful act.&mdash;O my master, I replied, give me two or three days'
delay that I may seek for a lodging:&mdash;and he assented to this, and
departed and left me. So I remained alone, and sat weeping, and
saying, How can I return to my family with my hand cut off? He
who cut it off knoweth not that I am innocent: perhaps, then, God
will bring about some event for my relief.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 564px; position: relative;"><a name="f124" id="f124"></a><img src="images/fig124.png" width="564" height="316" alt="The Arrest" title="The Arrest" /></div>

<p>I sat weeping violently; and when the owner of the &#7730;&aacute;'ah had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
departed from me, excessive grief overcame me, and I was sick for two
days; and on the third day, suddenly the owner of the &#7730;&aacute;'ah came to
me, with some officers of the police, and the chief of the market, and
accused me again of stealing the necklace. So I went out to them, and
said, What is the news?&mdash;whereupon, without granting me a moment's
delay, they bound my arms behind me, and put a chain around my
neck, saying to me, The necklace which was in thy possession hath
proved to be the property of the governor of Damascus, its Wezeer and
its Ruler: it hath been lost from the governor's house for a period of
three years, and with it was his daughter.&mdash;When I heard these words
from them, my limbs trembled, and I said within myself, They will
kill me! My death is inevitable! By Allah, I must relate my story
to the governor; and if he please he will kill me, or if he please he
will pardon me.&mdash;And when we arrived at the governor's abode, and
they had placed me before him, and he beheld me, he said, Is this he
who stole the necklace and went out to sell it? Verily ye have cut off
his hand wrongfully.&mdash;He then ordered that the chief of the market
should be imprisoned, and said to him, Give to this person the compensatory
fine for his hand,<a href="#V53" class="fnanchor">53</a> or I will hang thee and seize all thy
property. And he called out to his attendants, who took him and
dragged him away.</p>

<p>I was now left with the governor alone, after they had, by his permission,
loosed the chain from my neck, and untied the cords which
bound my arms; and the governor, looking towards me, said to me, O
my son, tell me thy story, and speak truth. How did this necklace
come into thy possession?&mdash;So I replied, O my lord, I will tell thee
the truth:&mdash;and I related to him all that had happened to me with
the first damsel, and how she had brought to me the second, and
murdered her from jealousy; on hearing which, he shook his head,
and covered his face with his handkerchief, and wept. Then looking
towards me, he said, Know, O my son, that the elder damsel was my
daughter: I kept her closely; and when she had attained a fit age for
marriage, I sent her to the son of her uncle in Cairo; but he died, and
she returned to me, having learnt habits of profligacy from the inhabitants
of that city:<a href="#V54" class="fnanchor">54</a> so she visited thee four times; and on the fourth
occasion, she brought to thee her younger sister. They were sisters
by the same mother, and much attached to each other; and when the
event which thou hast related occurred to the elder, she imparted her
secret to her sister, who asked my permission to go out with her;
after which the elder returned alone; and when I questioned her re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>specting
her sister, I found her weeping for her, and she answered, I know
no tidings of her:&mdash;but she afterwards informed her mother, secretly,
of the murder which she had committed; and her mother privately
related the affair to me; and she continued to weep for her incessantly,
saying, By Allah, I will not cease to weep for her until I die. Thy
account, O my son, is true; for I knew the affair before thou toldest
it me. See then, O my son, what hath happened: and now I request
of thee that thou wilt not oppose me in that which I am about to say;
and it is this:&mdash;I desire to marry thee to my youngest daughter; for
she is not of the same mother as they were:<a href="#V55" class="fnanchor">55</a> she is a virgin, and I
will receive from thee no dowry, but will assign to you both an allowance;
and thou shalt be to me as an own son.&mdash;I replied, Let it be as
thou desirest, O my master. How could I expect to attain unto such
happiness?&mdash;The governor then sent immediately a courier to bring
the property which my father had left me (for he had died since my
departure from him), and now I am living in the utmost affluence.</p>

<p>I wondered, said the Jew, at his history; and after I had remained
with him three days, he gave me a large sum of money; and I left
him, to set forth on a journey; and, arriving in this your country, my
residence here pleased me, and I experienced this which hath happened
to me with the humpback.</p>

<p>The King, when he had heard this story, said, This is not more
wonderful than the story of the humpback, and ye must all of you be
hanged, and especially the tailor, who is the source of all the mischief.
But he afterwards added, O tailor, if thou tell me a story more wonderful
than that of the humpback, I will forgive you your offences.
So the tailor advanced, and said,&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY TOLD BY THE TAILOR.</h5>

<p>Know, O King of the age, that what hath happened to me is more
wonderful than the events which have happened to all the others.
Before I met the humpback, I was, early in the morning, at an entertainment
given to certain tradesmen of my acquaintance, consisting of
tailors and linen-drapers and carpenters and others; and when the sun
had risen, the repast was brought for us to eat; and lo, the master of
the house came in to us, accompanied by a strange and handsome
young man, of the inhabitants of Baghd&aacute;d. He was attired in clothes
of the handsomest description, and was a most comely person, except
that he was lame; and as soon as he had entered and saluted us, we
rose to him; but when he was about to seat himself, he observed
among us a man who was a barber, whereupon he refused to sit down,
and desired to depart from us. We and the master of the house,
however, prevented him, and urged him to seat himself; and the host
conjured him, saying, What is the reason of thy entering, and then
immediately departing?&mdash;By Allah, O my master, replied he, offer me
no opposition; for the cause of my departure is this barber, who is
sitting with you. And when the host heard this, he was exceedingly
surprised, and said, How is it that the heart of this young man, who
is from Baghd&aacute;d, is troubled by the presence of this barber? We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
then looked towards him, and said, Relate to us the cause of thy displeasure
against this barber; and the young man replied, O company,
a surprising adventure happened to me with this barber in Baghd&aacute;d,
my city; and he was the cause of my lameness, and of the breaking of
my leg; and I have sworn that I will not sit in any place where he is
present, nor dwell in any town where he resides: I quitted Baghd&aacute;d
and took up my abode in this city, and I will not pass the next night
without departing from it.&mdash;Upon this, we said to him, We conjure
thee, by Allah, to relate to us thy adventure with him.&mdash;And the
countenance of the barber turned pale when he heard us make this
request. The young man then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>Know, O good people, that my father was one of the chief
merchants of Baghd&aacute;d; and God (whose name be exalted!) blessed him
with no son but myself; and when I grew up, and had attained to
manhood, my father was admitted to the mercy of God, leaving me
wealth and servants and other dependants; whereupon I began to
attire myself in clothes of the handsomest description, and to feed
upon the most delicious meats. Now God (whose perfection be
extolled!) made me to be a hater of women; and so I continued, until,
one day, I was walking through the streets of Baghd&aacute;d, when a party
of them stopped my way: I therefore fled from them, and, entering a
by-street which was not a thoroughfare, I reclined upon a ma&#7779;&#7789;abah at
its further extremity. Here I had been seated but a short time when,
lo, a window opposite the place where I sat was opened, and there
looked out from it a damsel like the full moon, such as I had never in
my life beheld. She had some flowers, which she was watering,
beneath the window; and she looked to the right and left, and then
shut the window, and disappeared from before me. Fire had been
shot into my heart, and my mind was absorbed by her; my hatred of
women was turned into love, and I continued sitting in the same place
until sunset, in a state of distraction from the violence of my passion,
when, lo, the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee of the city came riding along, with slaves before
him and servants behind him, and alighted, and entered the house
from which the damsel had looked out: so I knew that he must be
her father.</p>

<p>I then returned to my house, sorrowful; and fell upon my bed,
full of anxious thoughts; and my female slaves came in to me, and
seated themselves around me, not knowing what was the matter with
me; and I acquainted them not with my case, nor returned any
answers to their questions; and my disorder increased. The neigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>bours,
therefore, came to cheer me with their visits; and among those
who visited me was an old woman, who, as soon as she saw me, discovered
my state; whereupon she seated herself at my head, and, addressing
me in a kind manner, said, O my son, tell me what hath
happened to thee? So I related to her my story, and she said, O my
son, this is the daughter of the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee of Baghd&aacute;d, and she is kept in
close confinement: the place where thou sawest her is her apartment,
and her father occupies a large saloon below, leaving her alone; and
often do I visit her: thou canst obtain an interview with her only
through me: so brace up thy nerves. When I heard, therefore, what
she said, I took courage, and fortified my heart; and my family
rejoiced that day. I rose up firm in limb, and hoping for complete
restoration; and the old woman departed; but she returned with her
countenance changed, and said, O my son, ask not what she did when
I told her of thy case; for she said, If thou abstain not, O ill-omened
old woman, from this discourse, I will treat thee as thou deservest:&mdash;but
I must go to her a second time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px; position: relative;"><a name="f127" id="f127"></a><img src="images/fig127.png" width="400" height="420" alt="Young Man sitting on a Mastabah" title="Young Man sitting on a Mastabah" /></div>

<p>On hearing this, my disorder increased: after some days, however,
the old woman came again, and said, O my son, I desire of thee a
reward for good tidings. My soul returned to my body at these
words, and I replied, Thou shalt receive from me everything that thou
canst wish. She then said, I went yesterday to the damsel, and when
she beheld me with broken heart and weeping eye, she said to me, O
my aunt, wherefore do I see thee with contracted heart?&mdash;and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
she had thus said, I wept, and answered, O my daughter and mistress,
I came to thee yesterday from visiting a youth who loveth thee, and
he is at the point of death on thy account:&mdash;and, her heart being
moved with compassion, she asked, Who is this youth of whom thou
speakest? I answered, He is my son, and the child that is dear to my
soul: he saw thee at the window some days ago, while thou wast
watering thy flowers; and when he beheld thy face, he became
distracted with love for thee: I informed him of the conversation that
I had with thee the first time; upon which his disorder increased, and
he took to his pillow: he is now dying, and there is no doubt of his
fate.&mdash;And upon this, her countenance became pale, and she said, Is
this all on my account?&mdash;Yea, by Allah, I answered; and what dost
thou order me to do?&mdash;Go to him, said she; convey to him my salutation,
and tell him that my love is greater than his; and on Friday
next, before the congregational prayers, let him come hither: I will
give orders to open the door to him, and to bring him up to me, and
I will have a short interview with him, and he shall return before my
father comes back from the prayers.</p>

<p>When I heard these words of the old woman, the anguish which I
had suffered ceased; my heart was set at rest, and I gave her the suit
of clothes which I was then wearing, and she departed, saying to me,
Cheer up thy heart. I replied, I have no longer any pain. The
people of my house, and my friends, communicated, one to another,
the good news of my restoration to health, and I remained thus until
the Friday, when the old woman came in to me, and asked me respecting
my state: so I informed her that I was happy and well. I
then dressed and perfumed myself, and sat waiting for the people to
go to prayers, that I might repair to the damsel; but the old woman
said to me, Thou hast yet more than ample time, and if thou go to the
bath and shave, especially for the sake of obliterating the traces of thy
disorder, it will be more becoming.&mdash;It is a judicious piece of advice,
replied I; but I will shave my head first, and then go into the bath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 515px; position: relative;"><a name="f128" id="f128"></a><img src="images/fig128.png" width="515" height="437" alt="The Barber and the Young Man" title="The Barber and the Young Man" /></div>

<p>So I sent for a barber to shave my head, saying to the boy, Go to
the market, and bring me a barber, one who is a man of sense, little
inclined to impertinence, that he may not make my head ache by his
chattering. And the boy went, and brought this sheykh, who, on
entering, saluted me; and when I had returned his salutation, he said
to me, May God dispel thy grief and thine anxiety, and misfortunes
and sorrows! I responded, May God accept thy prayer! He then
said, Be cheerful, O my master, for health hath returned to thee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Dost thou desire to be shaved or to be bled?&mdash;for it hath been handed
down, on the authority of Ibn-'Abb&aacute;s,<a href="#V56" class="fnanchor">56</a> that the Prophet said, Whoso
shorteneth his hair on Friday, God will avert from him seventy
diseases;&mdash;and it hath been handed down also, on the same authority,
that the Prophet said, Whoso is cupped on Friday will not be secure
from the loss of sight and from frequent disease.&mdash;Abstain, said I,
from this useless discourse, and come immediately, shave my head, for
I am weak. And he arose, and, stretching forth his hand, took out a
handkerchief, and opened it; and lo, there was in it an astrolabe, consisting
of seven plates;<a href="#V57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and he took it, and went into the middle of
the court, where he raised his head towards the sun, and looked for a
considerable time; after which he said to me, Know that there have
passed, of this our day, which is Friday, and which is the tenth of
&#7778;afar,<a href="#V58" class="fnanchor">58</a> of the year 263<a href="#V59" class="fnanchor">59</a> of the Flight of the Prophet,&mdash;upon whom
be the most excellent of blessings and peace!&mdash;and the ascendant star
of which, according to the required rules of the science of computation,
is the planet Mars,&mdash;seven degrees<a href="#V60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and six minutes; and it happeneth
that Mercury hath come in conjunction with that planet; and this
indicateth that the shaving of hair is now a most excellent operation:
and it hath indicated to me, also, that thou desirest to confer a benefit
upon a person: and fortunate is he!&mdash;but after that, there is an an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>nouncement
that presenteth itself to me respecting a matter which I
will not mention to thee.</p>

<p>By Allah, I exclaimed, thou hast wearied me, and dissipated my
mind, and augured against me, when I required thee only to shave my
head: arise, then, and shave it; and prolong not thy discourse to me.
But he replied, By Allah, if thou knewest the truth of the case, thou
wouldst demand of me a further explication; and I counsel thee to do
this day as I direct thee, according to the calculations deduced from
the stars: it is thy duty to praise God, and not to oppose me; for I
am one who giveth thee good advice, and who regardeth thee with
compassion: I would that I were in thy service for a whole year, that
thou mightest do me justice; and I desire not any pay from thee for
so doing.&mdash;When I heard this, I said to him, Verily thou art killing
me this day, and there is no escape for me.&mdash;O my master, he replied,
I am he whom the people call E&#7779;-&#7778;&aacute;mit,<a href="#V61" class="fnanchor">61</a> on account of the paucity
of my speech, by which I am distinguished above my brothers; for
my eldest brother is named El-Ba&#7731;boo&#7731;;<a href="#V62" class="fnanchor">62</a> and the second, El-Hedd&aacute;r;
and the third, Ba&#7731;ba&#7731;; and the fourth is named El-Kooz
el-A&#7779;w&aacute;nee; and the fifth, El-Feshsh&aacute;r; and the sixth is named
Sha&#7731;&aacute;li&#7731;; and the seventh brother is named E&#7779;-&#7778;&aacute;mit; and he is
myself.</p>

<p>Now when this barber thus overwhelmed me with his talk, I felt
as if my gall-bladder had burst, and said to the boy, Give him a
quarter of a piece of gold, and let him depart from me for the sake of
Allah: for I have no need to shave my head. But the barber on
hearing what I said to the boy, exclaimed, What is this that thou hast
said, O my lord? By Allah, I will accept from thee no pay unless I
serve thee; and serve thee I must; for to do so is incumbent on me,
and to perform what thou requirest; and I care not if I receive from
thee no money. If thou knowest not my worth, I know thine; and
thy father&mdash;may Allah have mercy upon him!&mdash;treated us with beneficence;
for he was a man of generosity. By Allah, thy father sent
for me one day, like this blessed day, and when I went to him, he had
a number of his friends with him, and he said to me, Take some blood
from me. So I took the astrolabe, and observed the altitude for him,
and found the ascendant of the hour to be of evil omen, and that the
letting of blood would be attended with trouble: I therefore acquainted
him with this, and he conformed to my wish, and waited until the
arrival of the approved hour, when I took the blood from him. He
did not oppose me; but, on the contrary, thanked me; and in like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
manner all the company present thanked me; and thy father gave me
a hundred pieces of gold for services similar to the letting of blood.&mdash;May
God, said I, shew no mercy to my father for knowing such a man
as thou!&mdash;and the barber laughed, and exclaimed, There is no deity
but God! Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle! Extolled be the perfection
of Him who changeth others, but is not changed! I did not imagine
thee to be otherwise than a man of sense; but thou hast talked nonsense
in consequence of thine illness. God hath mentioned, in his
Excellent Book, those who restrain their anger, and who forgive men:<a href="#V63" class="fnanchor">63</a>&mdash;but
thou art excused in every case. I am unacquainted, however,
with the cause of thy haste; and thou knowest that thy father used to
do nothing without consulting me; and it hath been said, that the
person to whom one applies for advice should be trusted: now thou
wilt find no one better acquainted with the affairs of the world than
myself, and I am standing on my feet to serve thee. I am not displeased
with thee, and how then art thou displeased with me? But I
will have patience with thee on account of the favours which I have
received from thy father.&mdash;By Allah, said I, thou hast wearied me with
thy discourse, and overcome me with thy speech! I desire that thou
shave my head and depart from me.</p>

<p>I gave vent to my rage; and would have risen, even if he had
wetted my head, when he said, I knew that displeasure with me had
overcome thee; but I will not be angry with thee, for thy sense is weak,
and thou art a youth: a short time ago I used to carry thee on my
shoulder,<a href="#V64" class="fnanchor">64</a> and take thee to the school.&mdash;Upon this, I said to him, O
my brother, I conjure thee by Allah, depart from me that I may perform
my business, and go thou thy way. Then I rent my clothes;
and when he saw me do this, he took the razor, and sharpened it, and
continued to do so until my soul almost parted from my body; then
advancing to my head, he shaved a small portion of it; after which he
raised his hand, and said, O my lord, haste is from the Devil;&mdash;and
he repeated this couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Deliberate, and haste not to accomplish thy desire; and be merciful, so shalt thou meet with one merciful:</span>
<span class="i0">For there is no hand but God's hand is above it;<a href="#V65" class="fnanchor">65</a> nor oppressor that shall not meet with an oppressor.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>O my lord (he then continued), I do not imagine that thou knowest
my condition in society; for my hand lighteth upon the heads of kings
and emeers and wezeers and sages and learned men; and of such a
one as myself hath the poet said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The trades altogether are like a necklace, and this barber is the chief pearl of the strings.</span>
<span class="i0">He excelleth all that are endowed with skill, and under his hands are the heads of Kings.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;Leave, said I, that which doth not concern thee! Thou hast contracted
my heart, and troubled my mind.&mdash;I fancy that thou art in
haste, he rejoined. I replied, Yes! Yes! Yes!&mdash;Proceed slowly, said
he; for verily haste is from the Devil, and it giveth occasion to repentance
and disappointment; and he upon whom be blessing and peace<a href="#V66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
hath said, The best of affairs is that which is commenced with deliberation:&mdash;and,
by Allah, I am in doubt as to thine affair: I wish,
therefore, that thou wouldst make known to me what thou art hasting
to do; and may it be good; for I fear it is otherwise.</p>

<p>There now remained, to the appointed time, three hours; and he
threw the razor from his hand in anger, and, taking the astrolabe,
went again to observe the sun; then after he had waited a long time,
he returned, saying, There remain, to the hour of prayer, three hours,
neither more nor less. For the sake of Allah, said I, be silent; for
thou hast crumbled my liver!&mdash;and thereupon, he took the razor, and
sharpened it as he had done the first time, and shaved another portion
of my head. Then stopping again, he said, I am in anxiety on
account of thy hurry: if thou wouldst acquaint me with the cause of
it, it would be better for thee; for thou knowest that thy father used
to do nothing without consulting me.</p>

<p>I perceived now that I could not avoid his importunity, and said
within myself, The time of prayer is almost come, and I desire to go
before the people come out from the service: if I delay a little longer,
I know not how to gain admission to her. I therefore said to him,
Be quick, and cease from this chattering and impertinence; for I
desire to repair to an entertainment with my friends. But when he
heard the mention of the entertainment, he exclaimed, The day is a
blessed day for me! I yesterday conjured a party of my intimate
friends to come and feast with me, and forgot to prepare for them anything
to eat; and now I have remembered it. Alas for the disgrace
that I shall experience from them!&mdash;So I said to him, Be in no
anxiety on this account, since thou hast been told that I am going to-day
to an entertainment; for all the food and drink that is in my
house shall be thine if thou use expedition in my affair, and quickly
finish shaving my head.&mdash;May God recompense thee with every blessing!
he replied: describe to me what thou hast for my guests, that I
may know it. I have, said I, five dishes of meat, and ten fowls fricandoed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
and a roasted lamb.&mdash;Cause them to be brought before me,
he said, that I may see them. So I had them brought to him, and
he exclaimed, Divinely art thou gifted! How generous is thy soul!
But the incense and perfumes are wanting.&mdash;I brought him, therefore,
a box containing nedd<a href="#V67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and aloes-wood and ambergris and musk,
worth fifty pieces of gold.&mdash;The time had now become contracted, like
my own heart; so I said to him, Receive this, and shave the whole
of my head, by the existence of Mo&#7717;ammad, God bless and save
him! But he replied, By Allah, I will not take it until I see all that
it contains.&mdash;I therefore ordered the boy, and he opened the box to
him; whereupon the barber threw down the astrolabe from his hand,
and, seating himself upon the ground, turned over the perfumes and
incense and aloes-wood in the box until my soul almost quitted my body.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 429px; position: relative;"><a name="f129" id="f129"></a><img src="images/fig129.png" width="429" height="291" alt="The Barber and Servants with Dishes" title="The Barber and Servants with Dishes" /></div>

<p>He then advanced, and took the razor, and shaved another small
portion of my head; after which he said, By Allah, O my son, I
know not whether I should thank thee or thank thy father; for my
entertainment to-day is entirely derived from thy bounty and kindness,
and I have no one among my visiters deserving of it; for my
guests are, Zeytoon the bath-keeper, and &#7778;alee&#7841; the wheat-seller, and
'Owkal the bean-seller, and 'Akresheh the grocer, and &#7716;omeyd the
dustman, and 'Ak&aacute;rish the milk-seller, and each of these hath a peculiar
dance which he performeth, and peculiar verses which he reciteth;
and the best of their qualities is, that they are like thy servant, the
memlook who is before thee; and I, thy slave, know neither loquacity
nor impertinence. As to the bath-keeper, he saith, If I go not to the
feast, it cometh to my house!&mdash;and as to the dustman, he is witty,
and full of frolick: often doth he dance, and say, News, with my wife,
is not kept in a chest!&mdash;and each of my friends hath jests that another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
hath not: but the description is not like the actual observation. If
thou choose, therefore, to come to us, it will be more pleasant both to
thee and to us: relinquish, then, thy visit to thy friends of whom
thou hast told us that thou desirest to go to them; for the traces of
disease are yet upon thee, and probably thou art going to a people of
many words, who will talk of that which concerneth them not; or probably
there will be among them one impertinent person; and thy soul
is already disquieted by disease.&mdash;I replied, If it be the will of God,
that shall be on some other day:&mdash;but he said, It will be more proper
that thou first join my party of friends, that thou mayest enjoy their
conviviality, and delight thyself with their salt. Act in accordance
with the saying of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Defer not a pleasure when it can be had; for fortune often destroyeth our plans.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon this I laughed from a heart laden with anger, and said to
him, Do what I require, that I may go in the care of God, whose name
be exalted! and do thou go to thy friends, for they are waiting thine
arrival. He replied, I desire nothing but to introduce thee into the
society of these people; for verily they are of the sons of that class
among which is no impertinent person; and if thou didst but behold
them once, thou wouldst leave all thine own companions.&mdash;May God,
said I, give thee abundant joy with them, and I must bring them
together here some day.&mdash;If that be thy wish, he rejoined, and thou
wilt first attend the entertainment of thy friends this day, wait until I
take this present with which thou hast honoured me, and place it
before my friends, that they may eat and drink without waiting for me,
and then I will return to thee, and go with thee to thy companions;
for there is no false delicacy between me and my companions that
should prevent my leaving them: so I will return to thee quickly, and
repair with thee whithersoever thou goest.&mdash;Upon this I exclaimed,
There is no strength nor power but in God, the High, the Great! Go
thou to thy companions, and delight thy heart with them, and leave
me to repair to mine, and to remain with them this day, for they are
waiting my arrival.&mdash;But he said, I will not leave thee to go alone.&mdash;The
place to which I am going, said I, none can enter except myself.&mdash;I
suppose then, he rejoined, that thou hast an appointment to-day
with some female: otherwise, thou wouldst take me with thee; for I
am more deserving than all other men, and will assist thee to attain
what thou desirest. I fear that thou art going to visit some strange
woman, and that thy life will be lost; for in this city of Baghd&aacute;d no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
one can do anything of this kind, especially on such a day as this;
seeing that the W&aacute;lee of Baghd&aacute;d is a terrible, sharp sword.&mdash;Wo to
thee, O wicked old man! I exclaimed, what are these words with
which thou addressest me?&mdash;And upon this, he kept a long silence.</p>

<p>The time of prayer had now arrived, and the time of the Khu&#7789;beh<a href="#V68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
was near, when he had finished shaving my head: so I said to him,
Go with this food and drink to thy friends, and I will wait for thee
until thou return, and thou shalt accompany me:&mdash;and I continued
my endeavours to deceive him, that he might go away; but he said to
me, Verily thou art deceiving me, and wilt go alone, and precipitate
thyself into a calamity from which there will be no escape for thee: by
Allah! by Allah! then, quit not this spot until I return to thee and
accompany thee, that I may know what will be the result of thine
affair.&mdash;I replied, Well: prolong not thine absence from me. And he
took the food and drink and other things which I had given him, but
intrusted them to a porter to convey them to his abode, and concealed
himself in one of the by-streets. I then immediately arose. The
mu&euml;ddins on the men&aacute;rehs had chanted the Sel&aacute;m of Friday;<a href="#V69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and I
put on my clothes, and went forth alone, and, arriving at the by-street,
stopped at the door of the house where I had seen the damsel: and lo,
the barber was behind me, and I knew it not. I found the door open,
and entered; and immediately the master of the house returned from
the prayers, and entered the saloon, and closed the door; and I said
within myself, How did this devil discover me?</p>

<p>Now it happened, just at this time, for the fulfilment of God's
purpose to rend the veil of protection before me, that a female slave
belonging to the master of the house committed some offence, in consequence
of which he beat her, and she cried out; whereupon a male
slave came in to him to liberate her; but he beat him also, and he
likewise cried out; and the barber concluded that he was beating me;
so he cried, and rent his clothes, and sprinkled dust upon his head,
shrieking, and calling for assistance. He was surrounded by people,
and said to them, My master hath been killed in the house of the
&#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee! Then running to my house, crying out all the while, and
with a crowd behind him, he gave the news to my family; and I knew
not what he had done when they approached, crying, Alas for our
master!&mdash;the barber all the while being before them, with his clothes
rent, and a number of the people of the city with them. They continued
shrieking, the barber shrieking at their head, and all of them
exclaiming, Alas for our slain!&mdash;Thus they advanced to the house in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
which I was confined; and when the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee heard of this occurrence,
the event troubled him, and he arose, and opened the door, and seeing
a great crowd, he was confounded, and said, O people, what is the
news? The servants replied, Thou hast killed our master.&mdash;O people,
rejoined he, what hath your master done unto me that I should kill
him; and wherefore do I see this barber before you?&mdash;Thou hast just
now beaten him with mi&#7731;ra'ahs, said the barber; and I heard his cries.&mdash;What
hath he done that I should kill him? repeated the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee. And
whence, he added, came he; and whither would he go?&mdash;Be not an
old man of malevolence, exclaimed the barber; for I know the story, and
the reason of his entering thy house, and the truth of the whole affair:
thy daughter is in love with him, and he is in love with her; and thou
hast discovered that he had entered thy house, and hast ordered thy
young men, and they have beaten him. By Allah, none shall decide
between us and thee except the Khaleefeh; or thou shalt bring forth
to us our master that his family may take him; and oblige me not to
enter and take him forth from you: haste then thyself to produce him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px; position: relative;"><a name="f130" id="f130"></a><img src="images/fig130.png" width="350" height="439" alt="The Barber rending his Clothes" title="The Barber rending his Clothes" /></div>

<p>Upon this, the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee was withheld from speaking, and became
utterly abashed before the people: but presently he said to the barber,
If thou speak truth, enter thyself, and bring him forth. So the
barber advanced, and entered the house; and when I saw him do so,
I sought for a way to escape; but I found no place of refuge except
a large chest which I observed in the same apartment in which I then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
was: I therefore entered this, and shut down the lid, and held in my
breath. Immediately after, the barber ran into the saloon, and,
without looking in any other direction than that in which I had
concealed myself, came thither: then turning his eyes to the right
and left, and seeing nothing but the chest, he raised it upon his head;
whereupon my reason forsook me. He quickly descended with it;
and I, being now certain that he would not quit me, opened the chest,
and threw myself upon the ground. My leg was broken by the fall;
and when I came to the door of the house, I found a multitude of
people: I had never seen such a crowd as was there collected on that
day; so I began to scatter gold among them, to divert them; and
while they were busied in picking it up, I hastened through the by-streets
of Baghd&aacute;d, followed by this barber; and wherever I entered,
he entered after me, crying, They would have plunged me into
affliction on account of my master! Praise be to God who aided
me against them, and delivered my master from their hands! Thou
continuedst, O my master, to be excited by haste for the accomplishment
of thine evil design until thou broughtest upon thyself this
event; and if God had not blessed thee with me, thou hadst not
escaped from this calamity into which thou hast fallen; and they
might have involved thee in a calamity from which thou wouldst
never have escaped. Beg, therefore, of God, that I may live for thy
sake, to liberate thee in future. By Allah, thou hast almost destroyed
me by thine evil design, desiring to go alone: but we will not be
angry with thee for thine ignorance, for thou art endowed with little
sense, and of a hasty disposition.&mdash;Art thou not satisfied, replied I,
with that which thou hast done, but wilt thou run after me through
the market-streets?&mdash;And I desired for death to liberate me from
him; but found it not; and in the excess of my rage I ran from him,
and, entering a shop in the midst of the market, implored the
protection of its owner; and he drove away the barber from me.</p>

<p>I then seated myself in a magazine belonging to him, and said
within myself, I cannot now rid myself of this barber; but he will
be with me night and day, and I cannot endure the sight of his face.
So I immediately summoned witnesses, and wrote a document, dividing
my property among my family, and appointing a guardian over them,
and I ordered him to sell the house and all the immoveable possessions,
charging him with the care of the old and young, and set forth at once
on a journey in order to escape from this wretch. I then arrived in
your country, where I took up my abode, and have remained a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
considerable time; and when ye invited me, and I came unto you,
I saw this vile wretch among you, seated at the upper end of the
room. How, then, can my heart be at ease, or my sitting in your
company be pleasant to me, with this fellow, who hath brought these
events upon me, and been the cause of the breaking of my leg?</p>

<p>The young man still persevered in his refusal to remain with us;
and when we had heard his story, we said to the barber, Is this true
which the young man hath said of thee?&mdash;By Allah, he answered,
it was through my intelligence that I acted thus towards him; and
had I not done so, he had perished: myself only was the cause of
his escape; and it was through the goodness of God, by my means,
that he was afflicted by the breaking of his leg instead of being punished
by the loss of his life. Were I a person of many words,
I had not done him this kindness; and now I will relate to you an
event that happened to me, that ye may believe me to be a man of
few words, and less of an impertinent than my brothers; and it was
this:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE BARBER'S STORY OF HIMSELF</h5>

<p>I was living in Baghd&aacute;d, in the reign of the Prince of the Faithful
El-Munta&#7779;ir bi-ll&aacute;h,<a href="#V70" class="fnanchor">70</a> who loved the poor and indigent, and associated
with the learned and virtuous; and it happened, one day, that he was
incensed against ten persons, in consequence of which, he ordered the
chief magistrate of Baghd&aacute;d to bring them to him in a boat. I saw
them, and I said within myself, These persons have assembled for
nothing but an entertainment, and, I suppose, will pass their day in
this boat eating and drinking; and none shall be their companion
but myself:<a href="#V71" class="fnanchor">71</a>&mdash;so I embarked, and mixed myself among them; and
when they had landed on the opposite bank, the guards of the W&aacute;lee
came with chains, and put them upon their necks, and put a chain
upon my neck also.&mdash;Now this, O people, is it not a proof of my
generosity, and of my paucity of speech? For I determined not to
speak.&mdash;They took us, therefore, all together, in chains, and placed us
before El-Munta&#7779;ir bi-ll&aacute;h, the Prince of the Faithful; whereupon he
gave orders to strike off the heads of the ten; and the executioner
struck off the heads of the ten, and I remained. The Khaleefeh then
turning his eyes, and beholding me, said to the executioner, Wherefore
dost thou not strike off the heads of all the ten? He answered, I
have beheaded every one of the ten.&mdash;I do not think, rejoined the
Khaleefeh, that thou hast beheaded more than nine; and this who is
before me is the tenth. But the executioner replied, By thy beneficence,
they are ten.&mdash;Count them, said the Khaleefeh. And they
counted them; and lo, they were ten. The Khaleefeh then looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
towards me, and said, What hath induced thee to be silent on this
occasion; and how hast thou become included among the men of
blood?&mdash;And when I heard the address of the Prince of the Faithful,
I said to him, Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that I am the sheykh
E&#7779;-&#7778;&aacute;mit (the silent): I possess, of science, a large stock; and as to
the gravity of my understanding, and the quickness of my apprehension,
and the paucity of my speech, they are unbounded: my trade
is that of a barber; and yesterday, early in the morning, I saw these
ten men proceeding to the boat; whereupon I mixed myself with
them, and embarked with them, thinking that they had met together
for an entertainment; but soon it appeared that they were criminals;
and the guards came to them, and put chains upon their necks, and
upon my neck also they put a chain; and from the excess of my
generosity I was silent, and spoke not: my speech was not heard on
that occasion, on account of the excess of my generosity; and they
proceeded with us until they stationed us before thee, and thou gavest
the order to strike off the heads of the ten, and I remained before the
executioner, and acquainted you not with my case. Was not this
great generosity which compelled me to accompany them to slaughter?
But throughout my life I have acted in this excellent manner.</p>

<p>When the Khaleefeh heard my words, and knew that I was of a
very generous character, and of few words, and not inclined to
impertinence as this young man, whom I delivered from horrors,
asserteth, he said, Hast thou brothers? I answered, Yes: six.&mdash;And
are thy six brothers, said he, like thyself, distinguished by science and
knowledge, and paucity of speech? I answered, They lived not so as
to be like me: thou hast disparaged me by thy supposition, O Prince
of the Faithful, and it is not proper that thou shouldst compare my
brothers to me; for through the abundance of their speech, and the
smallness of their generous qualities, each of them experienced a defect:
the first was lame; the second, deprived of many of his teeth; the third,
blind; the fourth, one-eyed; the fifth, cropped of his ears; and the
sixth had both his lips cut off:<a href="#V72" class="fnanchor">72</a> and think not, O Prince of the
Faithful, that I am a man of many words: nay, I must prove to
thee that I am of a more generous character than they; and each
of them met with a particular adventure, in consequence of which
he experienced a defect: if thou please, I will relate their stories to
thee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<h5>THE BARBER'S STORY OF HIS FIRST BROTHER.</h5>

<p>Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that the first (who was named
El-Ba&#7731;boo&#7731;) was the lame one. He practised the art of a tailor in
Baghd&aacute;d, and used to sew in a shop which he hired of a man possessing
great wealth, who lived over the shop, and who had, in the lower
part of his house, a mill. And as my lame brother was sitting in his
shop one day, sewing, he raised his head, and saw a woman like the
rising full moon, at a projecting window of the house, looking at the
people passing by; and as soon as he beheld her, his heart was entangled
by her love. He passed that day gazing at her, and neglecting
his occupation, until the evening; and on the following morning
he opened his shop, and sat down to sew; but every time that he
sewed a stitch, he looked towards the window; and in this state he
continued, sewing nothing sufficient to earn a piece of silver.<a href="#V73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>On the third day he seated himself again in his place, looking
towards the woman; and she saw him, and, perceiving that he had
become enslaved by her love, laughed in his face, and he, in like
manner, laughed in her face. She then disappeared from before him,
and sent to him her slave-girl, with a wrapper containing a piece of
red flowered silk; and the girl, coming to him, said to him, My
mistress saluteth thee, and desireth thee to cut out for her, with the
hand of skill, a shirt of this piece, and to sew it beautifully. So he
answered, I hear and obey:&mdash;and he cut out for her the shirt, and
finished the sewing of it on that day; and on the following day the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
slave-girl came to him again; and said to him, My mistress saluteth
thee, and saith to thee, How didst thou pass last night?&mdash;for she
tasted not sleep, from her passion for thee.&mdash;She then placed before
him a piece of yellow satin, and said to him, My mistress desireth thee
to cut out for her, of this piece, two pairs of trousers, and to make
them this day. He replied, I hear and obey. Salute her with abundant
salutations, and say to her, Thy slave is submissive to thine order,
and command him to do whatsoever thou wilt.&mdash;He then busied himself
with the cutting out, and used all diligence in sewing the two
pairs of trousers; and presently the woman looked out at him from
the window, and saluted him by a sign, now casting down her eyes,
and now smiling in his face, so that he imagined he should soon obtain
possession of her. After this, she disappeared from before him, and
the slave-girl came to him; so he delivered to her the two pairs of
trousers, and she took them and departed: and when the night came,
he threw himself upon his bed, and remained turning himself over in
restlessness until the morning.</p>

<p>On the following day, the master of the house came to my brother,
bringing some linen, and said to him, Cut out and make this into
shirts for me. He replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and ceased not from his
work until he had cut out twenty shirts by the time of nightfall, without
having tasted food. The man then said to him, How much is thy
hire for this?&mdash;but my brother answered not; and the damsel made a
sign to him that he should receive nothing, though he was absolutely
in want of a single copper coin. For three days he continued scarcely
eating or drinking anything, in his diligence to accomplish his work,
and when he had finished it, he went to deliver the shirts.</p>

<p>Now the young woman had acquainted her husband with the state
of my brother's mind, but my brother knew not this; and she planned
with her husband to employ him in sewing without remuneration, and
moreover to amuse themselves by laughing at him: so, when he had
finished all the work that they gave him, they contrived a plot against
him, and married him to their slave-girl; and on the night when he
desired to introduce himself to her, they said to him, Pass this night
in the mill, and to-morrow thou shalt enjoy happiness. My brother,
therefore, thinking that their intention was good, passed the night in
the mill alone. Meanwhile, the husband of the young woman went to
the miller, and instigated him by signs to make my brother turn the
mill. The miller, accordingly, went in to him at midnight, and began
to exclaim, Verily this bull is lazy, while there is a great quantity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
wheat, and the owners of the flour are demanding it: I will therefore
yoke him in the mill, that he may finish the grinding of the flour:&mdash;and
so saying, he yoked my brother, and thus he kept him until near
morning, when the owner of the house came, and saw him yoked in
the mill, and the miller flogging him with the whip; and he left him,
and retired. After this, the slave-girl to whom he had been contracted
in marriage came to him early in the morning, and, having unbound
him from the mill, said to him, Both I and my mistress have been
distressed by this which hath befallen thee, and we have participated
in the burden of thy sorrow. But he had no tongue wherewith to
answer her, by reason of the severity of the flogging. He then
returned to his house; and lo, the sheykh who had performed the
marriage-contract came and saluted him, saying, May God prolong
thy life! May thy marriage be blessed!&mdash;May God not preserve the
liar! returned my brother: thou thousandfold villain! By Allah, I
went only to turn the mill in the place of the bull until the morning.&mdash;Tell
me thy story, said the sheykh:&mdash;and my brother told him what
had happened to him: upon which the sheykh said, Thy star agreeth
not with hers: but if thou desire that I should change for thee the
mode of the contract, I will change it for another better than it, that
thy star may agree with hers.<a href="#V74" class="fnanchor">74</a>&mdash;See then, replied my brother, if thou
hast any other contrivance to employ.</p>

<p>My brother then left him, and repaired again to his shop, hoping
that somebody might give him some work, with the profit of which he
might obtain his food; and lo, the slave-girl came to him. She had
conspired with her mistress to play him this trick, and said to him,
Verily, my mistress is longing for thee, and she hath gone up to look
at thy face from the window. And my brother had scarcely heard
these words when she looked out at him from the window, and, weeping,
said, Wherefore hast thou cut short the intercourse between us
and thee? But he returned her no answer: so she swore to him that
all that had happened to him in the mill was not with her consent;
and when my brother beheld her beauty and loveliness, the troubles
that had befallen him became effaced from his memory, and he
accepted her excuse, and rejoiced at the sight of her. He saluted her,
therefore, and conversed with her, and then sat a while at his work;
after which the slave-girl came to him, and said, My mistress saluteth
thee, and informeth thee that her husband hath determined to pass this
next night in the house of one of his intimate friends; wherefore,
when he hath gone thither, do thou come to her.&mdash;Now the husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
of the young woman had said to her, How shall we contrive when he
cometh to thee that I may take him and drag him before the W&aacute;lee?
She replied, Let me then play him a trick, and involve him in a
disgrace for which he shall be paraded throughout this city as an
example to others:&mdash;and my brother knew nothing of the craftiness of
women. Accordingly, at the approach of evening, the slave-girl came
to him, and, taking him by the hand, returned with him to her mistress,
who said to him, Verily, O my master, I have been longing for
thee.&mdash;Hasten then, said he, to give me a kiss, first of all. And his
words were not finished, when the young woman's husband came in
from his neighbour's house, and, seizing my brother, exclaimed to him,
By Allah, I will not loose thee but in the presence of the chief magistrate
of the police. My brother humbled himself before him; but,
without listening to him, he took him to the house of the W&aacute;lee, who
flogged him with whips, and mounted him upon a camel, and conveyed
him through the streets of the city, the people crying out, This is the
recompense of him who breaketh into the &#7717;areems of others!&mdash;and he
fell from the camel, and his leg broke: so he became lame. The
W&aacute;lee then banished him from the city; and he went forth, not knowing
whither to turn his steps: but I, though enraged, overtook him,
and brought him back; and I have taken upon myself to provide him
with meat and drink unto the present day.</p>

<p>The Khaleefeh laughed at my story, and exclaimed, Thou hast
spoken well:&mdash;but I replied, I will not accept this honour until thou
hast listened to me while I relate to thee what happened to the rest of
my brothers; and think me not a man of many words.&mdash;Tell me, said
the Khaleefeh, what happened to all thy brothers, and grace my ears
with these nice particulars: I beg thee to employ exuberance of diction
in thy relation of these pleasant tales.</p>

<h5>THE BARBER'S STORY OF HIS SECOND BROTHER.</h5>

<p>So I said, Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that my second
brother, whose name was El-Hedd&aacute;r,<a href="#V75" class="fnanchor">75</a> was going one day to transact
some business, when an old woman met him, and said to him, O man,
stop a little, that I may propose to thee a thing, which, if it please
thee, thou shalt do for me. My brother, therefore, stopped; and she
said to him, I will guide thee to a thing, and rightly direct thee to it,
on the condition that thy words be not many. So he said, Communicate
what thou hast to tell me:&mdash;and she proceeded thus:&mdash;What
sayest thou of a handsome house, with running water, and fruit and
wine, and a beautiful face to behold, and a smooth cheek to kiss, and
an elegant form to embrace; and to enjoy all these pleasures without
interruption? Now, if thou wilt act agreeably with the condition that
I have imposed upon thee, thou wilt see prosperity.&mdash;When my
brother had heard her words, he said to her, O my mistress, how is it
that thou hast sought me out in preference to all the rest of the creation
for this affair; and what is there in me that hath pleased thee?
She replied, Did I not say to thee that thou must not be a person of
many words? Be silent then, and come with me.</p>

<p>The old woman then went her way, my brother following her,
eager to enjoy the pleasures which she had described to him, until they
had entered a spacious house, when she went up with him to an upper
story, and my brother perceived that he was in a beautiful palace, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
which he beheld four damsels, than whom none more lovely had ever
been seen, singing with voices that would charm a heart as insensible
as stone. One of these damsels drank a cup of wine; and my brother
said to her, May it be attended with health and vigour!&mdash;and
advanced to wait upon her; but she prevented his doing so, giving
him to drink a cup of wine; and as soon as he had drunk it, she
slapped him on his neck. When he found that she treated him thus,
he went out from the chamber in anger, and with many words; but
the old woman, following him, made a sign to him with her eye that
he should return: so he returned, and seated himself, without speaking;
and upon this, the damsel slapped him again upon the back of
his neck until he became senseless; after which, recovering, he withdrew
again. The old woman, however, overtook him, and said to him,
Wait a little, and thou shalt attain thy wish.&mdash;How many times, said
he, shall I wait a little before I attain it? The old woman answered,
When she hath become exhilarated with wine thou shalt obtain her
favour. He therefore returned to his place, and resumed his seat.
All the four damsels then arose, and the old woman directed them to
divest my brother of his outer clothes, and to sprinkle some rose-water
upon his face; and when they had done so, the most beautiful one
among them said to him, May Allah exalt thee to honour! Thou
hast entered my abode, and if thou have patience to submit to my requisitions,
thou wilt attain thy wish.&mdash;O my mistress, he replied, I am
thy slave, and under thy authority.&mdash;Know then, said she, that I am
devotedly fond of frolic, and he who complieth with my demands will
obtain my favour. Then she ordered the other damsels to sing; and
they sang so that their hearers were in an ecstasy; after which the
chief lady said to one of the other damsels, Take thy master, and do
what is required, and bring him back to me immediately.</p>

<p>Accordingly, she took him away, ignorant of that which she was
about to do; and the old woman came to him, and said, Be patient;
for there remaineth but little to do. He then turned towards the
damsel, and the old woman said to him, Be patient: thou hast almost
succeeded, and there remaineth but one thing, which is, to shave thy
beard.&mdash;How, said he, shall I do that which will disgrace me among
the people? The old woman answered, She desireth this only to make
thee like a beardless youth, that there may be nothing on thy face to
prick her; for her heart is affected with a violent love for thee. Be
patient, therefore, and thou shalt attain thy desire.&mdash;So my brother
patiently submitted to the damsel's directions: his beard was shaven,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
and he was shorn also of his eyebrows and mustaches, and his face
was painted red, before the damsel took him back to the chief lady,
who, when she saw him, was at first frightened at him, and then
laughed until she fell backwards, and exclaimed, O my master, thou
hast gained me by these proofs of thine amiable manners! She then
conjured him by her life to arise and dance; and he did so; and there
was not a single cushion in the chamber that she did not throw at him.
In like manner also the other damsels threw at him various things, such
as oranges, and limes, and citrons, until he fell down senseless from
the pelting, while they slapped him incessantly upon the back of his
neck, and cast things in his face. But at length the old woman said
to him, Now thou hast attained thy wish. Know that there remaineth
to thee no more beating, nor doth there remain for thee to do more
than one thing, namely, this: it is her custom, when she is under the
influence of wine, to suffer no one to come near her until she hath
taken off her outer clothes; thou, being prepared in the like manner,
must run after her, and she will run before thee as though she were
flying from thee; but cease not to follow her from place to place until
thou overtake her. He arose, therefore, and did so: the lady ran
before, and as he followed her, she passed from chamber to chamber,
and he still ran after her. At last he heard her utter a slight sound
as she ran before him, and, continuing his pursuit, he suddenly found
himself in the midst of the street.</p>

<p>This street was in the market of the leather-sellers, who were then
crying skins for sale; and when the people there collected saw him in
this condition, almost naked, with shaven beard and eyebrows and
mustaches, and with his face painted red, they shouted at him, and
raised a loud laugh, and some of them beat him with the skins until he
became insensible. They then placed him upon an ass, and conducted
him to the W&aacute;lee, who exclaimed, What is this?&mdash;They answered, This
descended upon us from the house of the Wezeer, in this condition. And
the W&aacute;lee inflicted upon him a hundred lashes, and banished him from
the city: but I went out after him, and brought him back privately
into the city, and allotted him a maintenance. Had it not been for
my generous disposition, I had not borne with such a person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<h5>THE BARBER'S STORY OF HIS THIRD BROTHER.</h5>

<p>As to my third brother (the blind man, Ba&#7731;ba&#7731;), who was also
surnamed &#7730;uffeh,<a href="#V76" class="fnanchor">76</a> fate and destiny impelled him one day to a large
house, and he knocked at the door, hoping that its master would
answer him, and that he might beg of him a trifle. The owner called
out, Who is at the door?&mdash;but my brother answered not; and then
heard him call with a loud voice, Who is this? Still, however, he
returned him no answer; and he heard the sounds of his footsteps approaching
until he came to the door and opened it, when he said to
him, What dost thou desire? My brother answered, Something for
the sake of God, whose name be exalted!&mdash;Art thou blind? said the
man; and my brother answered, Yes.&mdash;Then give me thy hand
rejoined the master of the house;&mdash;so my brother stretched forth to
him his hand, and the man took him into the house, and led him up
from stair-case to stair-case until he had ascended to the highest platform
of the roof: my brother thinking that he was going to give him
some food or money: and when he had arrived at this highest terrace,
of his house, the owner said, What dost thou desire, O blind man!&mdash;I
desire something, he answered again, for the sake of God, whose name
be exalted!&mdash;May God, replied the man, open to thee some other
way!&mdash;What is this! exclaimed my brother: couldst thou not tell me
so when I was below?&mdash;Thou vilest of the vile! retorted the other:
why didst thou not ask of me something for the sake of God when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
thou heardest my voice the first time, when thou wast knocking at the
door?&mdash;What then, said my brother, dost thou mean to do to me?&mdash;The
man of the house answered, I have nothing to give thee.&mdash;Then
take me down the stairs, said my brother. The man replied, The way
is before thee. So my brother made his way to the stairs, and continued
descending until there remained, between him and the door,
twenty steps, when his foot slipped and he fell, and, rolling down,
broke his head.<a href="#V77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>He went forth, not knowing whither to direct his steps, and presently
there met him two blind men, his companions, who said to him,
What hath happened to thee this day? My brother, therefore, related
to them the event that had just befallen him: and then said to them,
O my brothers, I desire to take a portion of the money now in our
possession, to expend it upon myself.&mdash;Now the owner of the house
which he had just before entered had followed him to acquaint himself
with his proceedings, and without my brother's knowledge he walked
behind him until the latter entered his abode; when he went in after
him, still unknown. My brother then sat waiting for his companions;
and when they came in to him, he said to them, Shut the door, and
search the room, lest any stranger have followed us. When the
intruder, therefore, heard what he said, he arose, and clung to a rope
that was attached to the ceiling; and the blind men went feeling about
the whole of the chamber, and, finding no one, returned and seated
themselves by my brother, and brought forth their money, and counted
it; and lo, it was more than ten thousand pieces of silver. Having
done this, they laid it in a corner of the room, and each of them took
of the surplus of that sum as much as he wanted, and they buried the
ten thousand pieces of silver in the earth; after which, they placed
before themselves some food, and sat eating; but my brother heard
the sound of a stranger by his side, and said to his friends, Is there a
stranger among us? Then stretching forth his hand, it grasped the
hand of the intruder; whereupon he cried out to his companions, saying,
Here is a stranger!&mdash;and they fell upon him with blows until
they were tired, when they shouted out, O Muslims!<a href="#V78" class="fnanchor">78</a> a thief hath
come in upon us, and desireth to take our property!&mdash;and immediately
a number of persons collected around them.</p>

<p>Upon this, the stranger whom they accused of being a thief shut
his eyes, feigned to be blind like themselves, so that no one who saw
him doubted him to be so; and shouted, O Muslims! I demand protection
of Allah and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n! I demand protection of Allah and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
the W&aacute;lee! I demand protection of Allah and the Emeer! for I have
important information to give to the Emeer!&mdash;and before they could
collect their thoughts, the officers of the W&aacute;lee surrounded them and
took them all, including my brother, and conducted them before their
master. The W&aacute;lee said, What is your story?&mdash;and the stranger
replied, Hear my words, O W&aacute;lee; the truth of our case will not
become known to thee but by means of beating;<a href="#V79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and if thou wilt,
begin by beating me before my companions. The W&aacute;lee therefore
said, Throw down this man, and flog him with whips:&mdash;and accordingly
they threw him down and flogged him; and when the stripes
tortured him, he opened one of his eyes; and after they had continued
the flogging a little longer, he opened his other eye; upon which the
W&aacute;lee exclaimed, What meaneth this conduct, O thou villain?&mdash;Grant
me indemnity, replied the man, and I will acquaint thee:&mdash;and the
W&aacute;lee having granted his request, he said, We four pretend that we
are blind, and, intruding among other people, enter their houses, and
see their women, and employ stratagems to corrupt them, and to obtain
money from them. We have acquired, by these means, vast gain,
amounting to ten thousand pieces of silver; and I said to my companions,
Give me my due, two thousand and five hundred; and they
rose against me and beat me, and took my property. I beg protection,
therefore, of Allah and of thee; and thou art more deserving of my
share than they. If thou desire to know the truth of that which I
have said, flog each of them more than thou hast flogged me, and he
will open his eyes.</p>

<p>So the W&aacute;lee immediately gave orders to flog them, and the first
of them who suffered was my brother. They continued beating him
until he almost died; when the W&aacute;lee said to them, O ye scoundrels!
do ye deny the gracious gift of God, feigning yourselves to be blind?
My brother exclaimed, All&aacute;h! All&aacute;h! All&aacute;h! there is none among us
who seeth!&mdash;They then threw him down again, and ceased not to beat
him until he became insensible, when the W&aacute;lee said, Leave him until
he shall have recovered, and then give him a third flogging:&mdash;and in
the meantime, he gave orders to flog his companions, to give each of
them more than three hundred stripes; while the seeing man said to
them, Open your eyes, or they will flog you again after this time.
Then addressing himself to the W&aacute;lee, he said, Send with me some
person to bring thee the property; for these men will not open their
eyes, fearing to be disgraced before the spectators. And the W&aacute;lee
sent with him a man, who brought him the money; and he took it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
and gave to the informer, out of it, two thousand and five hundred
pieces of silver, according to the share which he claimed, in spite of
the others (retaining the rest), and banished from the city my brother
and the two other men; but I went forth, O Prince of the Faithful,
and, having overtaken my brother, asked him respecting his sufferings;
and he acquainted me with that which I have related unto thee. I
then brought him back secretly into the city, and allotted him a supply
of food and drink as long as he lived.</p>

<p>The Khaleefeh laughed at my story, and said, Give him a present,
and let him go:&mdash;but I replied, I will receive nothing until I have
declared to the Prince of the Faithful what happened to the rest of
my brothers, and made it manifest to him that I am a man of few
words:&mdash;whereupon the Khaleefeh said, Crack our ears, then, with
thy ridiculous stories, and continue to us thy disclosure of vices and
misdeeds. So I proceeded thus:&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE BARBER'S STORY OF HIS FOURTH BROTHER.</h5>

<p>My fourth brother, O Prince of the Faithful, was the one-eyed
(named El-Kooz el-A&#7779;w&aacute;nee): he was a butcher in Baghd&aacute;d, and both
sold meat and reared lambs; and the great and the rich had recourse
to him to purchase of him their meat; so that he amassed great wealth,
and became possessor of cattle and houses. Thus he continued to
prosper for a long time; and as he was in his shop, one day, there
accosted him an old man with a long beard, who handed to him some
money, saying, Give me some meat for it. So he took the money, and
gave him the meat; and when the old man had gone away, my
brother looked at the money which he had payed him, and, seeing that
it was of a brilliant whiteness, put it aside by itself. This old man
continued to repair to him during a period of five months, and my
brother always threw his money into a chest by itself; after which
period he desired to take it out for the purpose of buying some sheep;
but on opening the chest, he found all the contents converted into
white paper, clipped round; and he slapped his face, and cried out;
whereupon a number of people collected around him, and he related
to them his story, at which they were astonished.</p>

<p>He then went again, as usual, into his shop, and, having killed a
ram, and hung it up within the shop, he cut off some of the meat, and
suspended it outside, saying within himself, Perhaps now this old man
will come again, and if so, I will seize him:&mdash;and very soon after, the
old man approached with his money; upon which my brother arose,
and, laying hold upon him, began to cry out, O Muslims, come to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
aid, and hear what this scoundrel hath done unto me! But when the
old man heard his words, he said to him, Which will be more agreeable
to thee&mdash;that thou abstain from disgracing me, or that I disgrace thee,
before the people?&mdash;For what wilt thou disgrace me? said my
brother. The old man answered, For thy selling human flesh for
mutton.&mdash;Thou liest, thou accursed! exclaimed my brother.&mdash;None is
accursed, rejoined the old man, but he who hath a man suspended
in his shop. My brother said, If it be as thou hast asserted, my property
and blood shall be lawful to thee:&mdash;and immediately the old
man exclaimed, O ye people here assembled! verily this butcher
slaughtereth human beings, and selleth their flesh for mutton; and if
ye desire to know the truth of my assertion, enter his shop! So the
people rushed upon his shop, and beheld the ram converted into a man,
hung up; and they laid hold upon my brother, crying out against him,
Thou infidel! Thou scoundrel!&mdash;and those who had been his dearest
friends turned upon him and beat him; and the old man gave him a
blow upon his eye, and knocked it out. The people then carried the
carcass, and took with them my brother, to the chief magistrate of the
police; and the old man said to him, O Emeer, this man slaughtereth
human beings, and selleth their flesh for mutton; and we have therefore
brought him to thee: arise, then, and perform the requisition of
God, whose might and glory be extolled! Upon this, the magistrate
thrust back my brother from him, and, refusing to listen to what he
would have said, ordered that five hundred blows of a staff should be
inflicted upon him, and took all his property. Had it not been for
the great amount of his wealth, he had put him to death.<a href="#V80" class="fnanchor">80</a> He then
banished him from the city.</p>

<p>My brother, therefore, went forth in a state of distraction, not
knowing what course to pursue; but he journeyed onwards until he
arrived at a great city, where he thought fit to settle as a shoemaker:
so he opened a shop, and sat there working for his subsistence. And
one day he went forth on some business, and, hearing the neighing of
horses, he inquired respecting the cause, and was told that the King
was going forth to hunt; whereupon he went to amuse himself with
the sight of the procession: but the King happening to look on one
side, his eye met that of my brother, and immediately he hung down
his head, and exclaimed, I seek refuge with God from the evil of this
day! He then turned aside the bridle of his horse, and rode back,
and all his troops returned with him; after which, he ordered his
pages to run after my brother, and to beat him; and they did so,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
giving him so severe a beating that he almost died; and he knew not
the cause. He returned to his abode in a miserable plight, and afterwards
went and related his misfortune to one of the King's attendants,
who laughed at the recital until he fell backwards, and said to him, O
my brother, the King cannot endure the sight of a one-eyed person,
and especially when the defect is that of the left eye;<a href="#V81" class="fnanchor">81</a> for in this case,
he faileth not to put the person to death.</p>

<p>When my brother heard these words, he determined to fly from
that city; and forthwith departed from it, and repaired to another
city, where there was no King. Here he remained a long time; and
after this, as he was meditating upon his adventure in the former city,
he went out one day to amuse himself, and heard again the neighing
of horses behind him; upon which he exclaimed, The decree of God
hath come to pass! and ran away, seeking for a place in which to
conceal himself; but he found none, until, continuing his search, he
saw a door set up as a barricade: so he pushed this, and it fell down;
and, entering the doorway, he beheld a long passage, into which he
advanced. Suddenly, however, two men laid hold upon him, and exclaimed,
Praise be to God who hath enabled us to take thee, O thou
enemy of God! For these three nights thou hast suffered us to enjoy
neither quiet nor sleep, and we have found no repose: nay, thou hast
given us a foretaste of death!&mdash;O men, said my brother, what hath
happened unto you? They answered, Thou keepest a watch upon us,
and desirest to disgrace us, and to disgrace the master of the house!
Is it not enough for thee that thou hast reduced him to poverty, thou
and thy companions? Produce now the knife wherewith thou threatenest
us every night.&mdash;And so saying, they searched him, and found
upon his waist the knife with which he cut the shoe-leather.&mdash;O men,
he exclaimed, fear God in your treatment of me, and know that my
story is wonderful. They said, What then is thy story? So he
related it to them, in the hope that they would liberate him: but they
believed not what he said; and, instead of shewing him any regard,
they beat him, and tore his clothes; whereupon, his body becoming
exposed to their view, they discovered upon his sides the marks of beating
with mi&#7731;ra'ahs, and exclaimed, O wretch! these scars bear testimony
to thy guilt. They then conducted him before the W&aacute;lee, while
he said within himself, I am undone for my transgressions, and none
can deliver me but God, whose name be exalted! And when he was
brought before the W&aacute;lee, the magistrate said to him, O thou scoundrel!
nothing but a heinous crime hath occasioned thy having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
beaten with mi&#7731;ra'ahs:&mdash;and he caused a hundred lashes to be inflicted
upon him; after which, they mounted him upon a camel, and
proclaimed before him, This is the recompense of him who breaketh
into men's houses!&mdash;But I had already heard of his misfortunes, and
gone forth, and found him; and I accompanied him about the city
while they were making this proclamation, until they left him; when
I took him, and brought him back secretly into Baghd&aacute;d, and apportioned
him a daily allowance of food and drink.</p>

<h5>THE BARBER'S STORY OF HIS FIFTH BROTHER.<a href="#V82" class="fnanchor">82</a></h5>

<p>My fifth brother (El-Feshsh&aacute;r<a href="#V83" class="fnanchor">83</a>) was cropped of his ears, O Prince
of the Faithful. He was a pauper, who begged alms by night, and
subsisted upon what he thus acquired by day: and our father was a
very old man, and he fell sick and died, leaving to us seven hundred
pieces of silver, of which each of us took his portion; namely, a
hundred pieces. Now my fifth brother, when he had received his
share, was perplexed, not knowing what to do with it; but while he
was in this state, it occurred to his mind to buy with it all kinds of
articles of glass, and to sell them and make profit; so he bought glass
with his hundred pieces of silver, and put it in a large tray, and sat
upon an elevated place, to sell it, leaning his back against a wall. And
as he sat, he meditated, and said within himself, Verily my whole
stock consisteth of this glass: I will sell it for two hundred pieces of
silver; and with the two hundred I will buy other glass, which I will
sell for four hundred; and thus I will continue buying and selling
until I have acquired great wealth. Then with this I will purchase all
kinds of merchandise and essences and jewels, and so obtain vast gain.
After that, I will buy a handsome house, and memlooks, and horses, and
gilded saddles; and I will eat and drink; and I will not leave in the
city a single female singer but I will have her brought to my house
that I may hear her songs.&mdash;All this he calculated with the tray of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
glass lying before him.&mdash;Then, said he, I will send all the female betrothers
to seek in marriage for me the daughters of Kings and
Wezeers; and I will demand as my wife the daughter of the chief
Wezeer;<a href="#V84" class="fnanchor">84</a> for I have heard that she is endowed with perfect beauty
and surprising loveliness: and I will give as her dowry a thousand

<span class="figleft3" style="width: 532px; position: relative;"><a name="f141a" id="f141a"></a><img src="images/fig141a.png" width="532" height="598" alt="The Reverie of the Barber's Fifth Brother" title="The Reverie of the Barber's Fifth Brother" /></span>

pieces of gold. If her father consent, my wish
is attained; and if he consent not, I will take
her by force, in spite of him: and when I have
come back to my house, I will buy ten young
eunuchs, and I will purchase the apparel of
Kings and Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns, and cause to be made for
me a saddle of gold set with jewels: after which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
I will ride every day upon a horse,

<span class="figright3t" style="width: 222px; position: relative;"><a name="f142a" id="f142a"></a><img src="images/fig142a.png" width="222" height="108" alt="The Reverie of the Barber's Fifth Brother" title="The Reverie of the Barber's Fifth Brother" /></span>

with slaves behind me and before me,<a href="#V85" class="fnanchor">85</a>
and go about through the streets and
markets to amuse myself, while the
people will salute me and pray for me.<a href="#V86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
Then I will pay a visit to the Wezeer, who
is the father of the maiden, with memlooks
behind me and before me, and on my right hand
and on my left; and when he seeth me, he will
rise to me, in humility, and seat me in his own
place; and he himself will sit down below me,<a href="#V87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
because I am his son-in-law. I will then order one
of the servants to bring a purse containing the
pieces of gold which compose the dowry; and he
will place it before the Wezeer; and I will add to
it another purse, that he may know my manly
spirit and excessive generosity, and that the world
is contemptible in my eye: and when he addresseth
me with ten words, I will answer him with two.
And I will return to my house; and when any
person cometh to me from the house of the Wezeer,
I will clothe him with a rich dress: but if any
come with a present, I will return it: I will certainly
not accept it.<a href="#V88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Then, on the night of the
bridal display, I will attire myself in the most
magnificent of my dresses, and sit upon a mattress
covered with silk; and when my wife cometh to
me, like the full moon, decked with her ornaments
and apparel, I will command her to stand before
me as stands the timid and the abject; and I will
not look at her, on account of the haughtiness
of my spirit and the gravity of my wisdom;
so that the maids will say, O our master and
our lord, may we be thy sacrifice!
This thy wife, or rather
thy handmaid, awaiteth thy
kind regard, and is standing
before thee: then graciously
bestow on her one glance; for
the posture hath become painful
to her.<a href="#V89" class="fnanchor">89</a>&mdash;Upon this, I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>

<span class="figright3t" style="width: 173px; position: relative;"><a name="f143a" id="f143a"></a><img src="images/fig143a.png" width="173" height="173" alt="The Reverie of the Barber's Fifth Brother" title="The Reverie of the Barber's Fifth Brother" /></span>

raise my head, and look at her with one
glance, and again incline my head downwards;
and thus I will do until the ceremony
of displaying her is finished; whereupon
they will conduct her to the sleeping-chamber;
and I will rise from my place,
and go to another apartment, and put on
my night-dress, and go to the chamber in
which she is sitting, where I will seat myself
upon the deew&aacute;n; but I will not look towards
her. The tire-women will urge me to approach
her; but I will not hear their words, and will
order some of the attendants to bring a purse
containing five hundred pieces of gold for them,
and command them to retire from the chamber.<a href="#V90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
And when they have gone, I will seat myself
by the side of the bride; but with averted
countenance, that she may say, Verily this is
a man of a haughty spirit. Then her mother
will come to me, and will kiss my hands, and
say to me, O my master, look upon thy handmaid
with the eye of mercy; for she is submissively
standing before thee. But I will return
her no answer. And she will kiss my feet,
again and again, and will say, O my master,
my daughter is young, and hath seen no man
but thee; and if she experience from thee repugnance,
her heart will break: incline to her,
therefore, and speak to her, and calm her mind.
And upon this I will look at her through the
corner of my eye, and command her to remain
standing before me, that she may taste the
savour of humiliation, and know that I am the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of the age. Then her mother will say to
me, O my master, this is thy handmaid:
have compassion upon her, and be gracious
to her:&mdash;and she will order her to fill a cup
with wine, and to put it to my mouth. So
her daughter will say, O my lord, I conjure
thee by Allah that thou reject not the cup
from thy slave; for verily I am thy slave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
But I will make her no reply; and she will

<span class="figright3t" style="width: 180px; position: relative;"><a name="f144a" id="f144a"></a><img src="images/fig144a.png" width="180" height="319" alt="The Reverie of the Barber's Fifth Brother" title="The Reverie of the Barber's Fifth Brother" /></span>

urge me to take it, and will say, It must be
drunk:&mdash;and will put it to my mouth: and
upon this, I will shake my hand in her face,
and spurn her with my foot, and do thus.&mdash;So
saying, he kicked the tray of glass, which,
being upon a place elevated above the ground,
fell, and all that was in it broke: there escaped
nothing: and he cried out and said, All this is
the result of my pride! And he slapped his
face, and tore his clothes; the passengers
gazing at him, while he wept, and exclaimed,
Ah! O my grief!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span></p>

<p>The people were now repairing to perform the Friday-prayers; and
some merely cast their eyes at him, while others noticed him not: but
while he was in this state, deprived of his whole property, and weeping
without intermission, a female approached him, on her way to
attend the Friday-prayers: she was of admirable loveliness; the odour
of musk was diffused from her; under her was a mule with a stuffed
saddle covered with gold-embroidered silk; and with her was a number
of servants; and when she saw the broken glass, and my brother's
state and his tears, she was moved with pity for him, and asked
respecting his case. She was answered, He had a tray of glass, by the
sale of which to obtain his subsistence and it is broken, and he is
afflicted as thou seest:&mdash;and upon this, she called to one of the
servants, saying, Give what thou hast with thee to this poor man. So
he gave him a purse, and he took it, and when he had opened it, he
found in it five hundred pieces of gold, whereupon he almost died
from excessive joy, and offered up prayers for his benefactress.</p>

<p>He returned to his house a rich man, and sat reflecting, and lo, a
person knocked at the door: he rose, therefore, and opened it; and
beheld an old woman whom he knew not, and she said to him, O my
son, know that the time of prayer hath almost expired, and I am not
prepared by ablution; wherefore I beg that thou wilt admit me into
thy house, that I may perform it. He replied, I hear and obey;&mdash;and,
retiring within, gave her permission to enter; his mind still
wandering from joy on account of the gold; and when she had finished
the ablution, she approached the spot where he was sitting, and there
performed the prayers of two rek'ahs. She then offered up a supplication
for my brother; and he thanked her, and offered her two pieces
of gold; but when she saw this, she exclaimed, Extolled be God's perfection!
Verily I wonder at the person who fell in love with thee in
thy beggarly condition! Take back thy money from me, and if thou
want it not, return it to her who gave it thee when thy glass broke.&mdash;O
my mother, said he, how can I contrive to obtain access to her?
She answered, O my son, she hath an affection for thee; but she is
the wife of an affluent man; take then with thee all thy money, and
when thou art with her be not deficient in courteousness and agreeable
words; so shalt thou obtain of her favours and her wealth whatever
thou shalt desire. My brother, therefore, took all the gold, and arose
and went with the old woman, hardly believing what she had told
him; and she proceeded, and my brother behind her, until they arrived
at a great door, at which she knocked; whereupon a Greek damsel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
came and opened the door, and the old woman entered, ordering my
brother to do the same. He did so, and found himself in a large
house, where he beheld a great furnished chamber, with curtains hung
in it; and, seating himself there, he put down the gold before him,
and placed his turban on his knees;<a href="#V91" class="fnanchor">91</a> and scarcely had he done so,
when there came to him a damsel, the like of whom had never been
seen, attired in most magnificent apparel. My brother stood up at her
approach; and when she beheld him, she laughed in his face, and
rejoiced at his visit: then going to the door, she locked it; after
which she returned to my brother, and took his hand, and both of
them went together into a private chamber, carpeted with various
kinds of silk, where my brother sat down, and she seated herself by
his side, and toyed with him for a considerable time. She then rose,
saying to him, Move not from this place until I return to thee;&mdash;and
was absent from him for a short period;&mdash;and as my brother was waiting
for her, there came in to him a black slave, of gigantic stature, with
a drawn sword, the brightness of which dazzled the sight; and he
exclaimed to my brother. Wo to thee! Who brought thee to this
place? Thou vilest of men! Thou misbegotten wretch, and nursling
of impurity!&mdash;My brother was unable to make any reply; his tongue
was instantly tied; and the slave laid hold upon him, and stripped
him, and struck him more than eighty blows with the flat of his sword,
until he fell sprawling upon the floor; when he retired from him, concluding
that he was dead, and uttered a great cry, so that the earth
trembled, and the place resounded at his voice, saying, Where is
El-Melee&#7717;ah?<a href="#V92" class="fnanchor">92</a>&mdash;upon which a girl came to him, holding a handsome
tray containing salt; and with this she forthwith stuffed the flesh-wounds
with which my brother's skin was gashed until they gaped
open; but he moved not, fearing the slave would discover that he was
alive, and kill him. The girl then went away, and the slave uttered
another cry, like the first, whereupon the old woman came to my
brother, and, dragging him by the feet to a deep and dark vault,
threw him into it upon a heap of slain.<a href="#V93" class="fnanchor">93</a> In this place he remained
for two whole days; and God (whose perfection be extolled!) made
the salt to be the means of preserving his life, by stanching the flow of
blood from his veins; so, when he found that he had strength sufficient
to move, he arose, and, opening a shutter in the wall, emerged from
the place of the slain; and God (to whom be ascribed all might and
glory!) granted him his protection. He therefore proceeded in the
darkness, and concealed himself in the passage until the morning, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
the old woman went forth to seek another victim, and my brother,
going out after her, without her knowledge, returned to his house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px; position: relative;"><a name="f146" id="f146"></a><img src="images/fig146.png" width="417" height="472" alt="The Second Misfortune of the Barber's Fifth Brother" title="The Second Misfortune of the Barber's Fifth Brother" /></div>

<p>He now occupied himself with the treatment of his wounds until
he was restored; and continued to watch for the old woman, and constantly
saw her taking men, one after another, and conducting them
to the same house. But he uttered not a word on the subject; and
when his health returned, and his strength was completely renewed, he
took a piece of rag, and made of it a purse, which he filled with pieces
of glass: he then tied it to his waist, and disguised himself so that no
one would know him, in the dress of a foreigner; and, taking a sword,
placed it within his clothes; and as soon as he saw the old woman, he
said to her, in the dialect of a foreigner, Old woman, hast thou a pair
of scales fit for weighing nine hundred pieces of gold? The old
woman answered, I have a young son, a money-changer, and he hath
all kinds of scales; therefore accompany me to him before he go forth
from his abode, that he may weigh for thee thy gold. So my brother
said, Walk on before me:&mdash;and she went, and my brother followed
her until she arrived at the door, and knocked; upon which the girl
came out, and laughed in his face; and the old woman said to her, I
have brought you to-day some fat meat. The girl then took my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
brother's hand, and conducted him into the house (the same which he
had entered before), and after she had sat with him a short time, she
rose, saying to him, Quit not this place until I return to thee:&mdash;and
she retired; and my brother had remained not long after when the
slave came to him with the drawn sword, and said to him, Rise, thou
unlucky! So my brother rose, and, as the slave walked before him,
he put his hand to the sword which was concealed beneath his clothes,
and struck the slave with it, and cut off his head; after which he
dragged him by his feet to the vault, and called out, Where is
El-Melee&#7717;ah? The slave-girl, therefore, came, having in her hand the
tray containing the salt; but when she saw my brother with the sword
in his hand, she turned back and fled: my brother, however, overtook
her, and struck off her head. He then called out, Where is the old
woman?&mdash;and she came; and he said to her, Dost thou know me, O
malevolent hag? She answered, No, O my lord.&mdash;I am, said he, the
man who had the pieces of gold, and in whose house thou performedst
the ablution and prayedst; after which, devising a stratagem against
me, thou betrayedst me into this place.&mdash;The old woman exclaimed,
Fear God in thy treatment of me!&mdash;but my brother, turning towards
her, struck her with the sword, and clove her in twain. He then went
to search for the chief damsel, and when she saw him, her reason fled,
and she implored his pardon; whereupon he granted her his pardon,
and said to her, What occasioned thy falling into the hands of this
black? She answered, I was a slave to one of the merchants, and this
old woman used to visit me; and one day she said to me, We are
celebrating a festivity, the like of which no one hath seen, and I have
a desire that thou shouldst witness it. I replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and
arose, and clad myself in the best of my attire, and, taking with
me a purse containing a hundred pieces of gold,<a href="#V94" class="fnanchor">94</a> proceeded with her
until she entered this house, when suddenly this black took me, and
I have continued with him in this state three years, through the
stratagem of the old witch.&mdash;My brother then said to her, Is there
any property of his in the house?&mdash;Abundance, she answered; and if
thou canst remove it, do so:&mdash;and upon this, he arose and went with
her, when she opened to him chests filled with purses, at the sight of
which he was confounded; and she said to him, Go now, and leave
me here, and bring some person to remove the property. So he
went out, and, having hired ten men, returned; but on his arrival at
the door, he found it open, and saw neither the damsel nor the purses;
he found, however, some little money remaining, and the stuffs. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
discovered, therefore, that she had eluded him; and he took the money
that remained, and, opening the closets, took all the stuffs which they
contained, leaving nothing in the house.</p>

<p>He passed the next night full of happiness; but when the morning
came, he found at the door twenty soldiers, and on his going forth to
them, they laid hold upon him, saying, The W&aacute;lee summoneth thee.
So they took him, and conducted him to the W&aacute;lee, who, when he saw
him, said to him, Whence obtainedst thou these stuffs?&mdash;Grant me indemnity,
said my brother:&mdash;and the W&aacute;lee gave him the handkerchief
of indemnity;<a href="#V95" class="fnanchor">95</a> and my brother related to him all that had befallen him
with the old woman from first to last, and the flight of the damsel;
adding,&mdash;and of that which I have taken, take thou what thou wilt;
but leave me wherewith to procure my food. The W&aacute;lee thereupon
demanded the whole of the money and the stuffs; but fearing that the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n<a href="#V96" class="fnanchor">96</a> might become acquainted with the matter, he retained a
portion only, and gave the rest to my brother, saying to him, Quit this
city, or I will hang thee. My brother replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and
went forth to one of the surrounding cities. Some robbers, however,
came upon him, and stripped and beat him, and cut off his ears; and
I, having heard of his situation, went forth to him, taking to him
some clothes; and brought him back privily into the city, and supplied
him with daily food and drink.</p>

<h5>THE BARBER'S STORY OF HIS SIXTH BROTHER</h5>

<p>My sixth brother (Sha&#7731;&aacute;li&#7731;), O Prince of the Faithful, had his lips
cut off. He was in a state of extreme poverty, possessing nothing of
the goods of this perishable world; and he went forth one day to seek
for something with which to stay his departing spirit, and on his way
he beheld a handsome house, with a wide and lofty vestibule, at the
door of which were servants, commanding and forbidding; whereupon
he inquired of one of the persons standing there, who answered, This
house belongeth to a man of the sons of the Barmekees.<a href="#V97" class="fnanchor">97</a> My
brother, therefore, advanced to the door-keepers, and begged them to
give him something; and they said, Enter the door of the house, and
thou wilt obtain what thou desirest of its master.  So he entered the
vestibule, and proceeded through it a while until he arrived at a
mansion of the utmost beauty and elegance, having a garden in the
midst of it, unsurpassed in beauty by anything that had ever been
seen: its floors were paved with marble, and its curtains were hanging
around. He knew not in which direction to go; but advanced to the
upper extremity, and there he beheld a man of handsome countenance
and beard, who, on seeing my brother, rose to him, and welcomed
him, inquiring respecting his circumstances. He accordingly informed
him that he was in want; and when the master of the house heard his
words, he manifested excessive grief, and, taking hold of his own
clothes, rent them, and exclaimed, Am I in the city, and thou in it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
hungry? It is a thing that I cannot endure!&mdash;Then promising him
every kind of happiness, he said, Thou must stay and partake of my
salt. But my brother replied, O my master, I have not patience to
wait; for I am in a state of extreme hunger.</p>

<p>Upon this, the master of the house called out, Boy, bring the
basin and ewer!&mdash;and he said, O my guest, advance, and wash thy
hand. He then performed the same motions as if he were washing his
hand; and called to his attendants to bring the table; whereupon
they began to come and go as though they were preparing it; after
which the master of the house took my brother, and sat down with him
at this imaginary table, and proceeded to move his hands and lips as
if he were eating; saying to my brother, Eat, and be not ashamed, for
thou art hungry, and I know how thou art suffering from the violence
of thy hunger. My brother, therefore, made the same motions, as if
he also were eating, while his host said to him, Eat, and observe this
bread and its whiteness. To this, my brother at first made no reply;
but observed in his own mind, Verily this is a man who loveth to jest
with others:&mdash;so he said to him, O my master, in my life I have never
seen bread more beautifully white than this, or any of sweeter taste:&mdash;on
which the host rejoined, This was made by a female slave of
mine whom I purchased for five hundred pieces of gold. He then
called out, Boy, bring to us the sikb&aacute;j,<a href="#V98" class="fnanchor">98</a> the like of which is not found
among the dishes of Kings!&mdash;and, addressing my brother, he said,
Eat, O my guest; for thou art hungry, vehemently so, and in absolute
want of food. So my brother began to twist about his mouth, and to
chew, as in eating. The master of the house now proceeded to
demand different kinds of viands, one after another; and, though
nothing was brought, he continued ordering my brother to eat. Next
he called out, Boy, place before us the chickens stuffed with pistachio-nuts:&mdash;and
said to his guest, Eat of that which thou hast never tasted
the like.&mdash;O my master, replied my brother, verily this dish hath not
its equal in sweetness of flavour:&mdash;and the host, thereupon, began to
put his hand to my brother's mouth as though he were feeding him
with morsels; and proceeded to enumerate to him the various different
kinds of viands, and to describe their several excellencies; while his
hunger so increased that he longed for a cake of barley-bread. The
master of the house then said to him, Hast thou tasted anything more
delicious than the spices in these dishes?&mdash;No, O my master, answered
my brother.&mdash;Eat more then, resumed the host; and be not ashamed.&mdash;I
have eaten enough of the meats, replied the guest. So the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
of the house called to his attendants to bring the sweets; and they
moved their hands about in the air as if they were bringing them;
whereupon the host said to my brother, Eat of this dish; for it is
excellent; and of these &#7731;a&#7789;&aacute;&iuml;f,<a href="#V99" class="fnanchor">99</a> by my life! and take this one before
the sirup runs from it.&mdash;May I never be deprived of thee, O my master!
exclaimed my brother, proceeding to inquire of him respecting the
abundance of musk in the &#7731;a&#7789;&aacute;&iuml;f.&mdash;This, answered the host, is my
usual custom in my house: they always put for me, in each of the
&#7731;a&#7789;&aacute;&iuml;f, a mith&#7731;&aacute;l<a href="#V100" class="fnanchor">100</a> of musk, and half a mith&#7731;&aacute;l of ambergris.&mdash;All
this time my brother was moving his head and mouth, and rolling
about his tongue between his cheeks, as if he were enjoying the sweets.
After this, the master of the house called out to his attendants,
Bring the dried fruits!&mdash;and again they moved about their hands in
the air as though they were doing what he ordered; when he said to
my brother, Eat of these almonds, and of these walnuts, and of these
raisins;&mdash;and so on; enumerating the various kinds of dried fruits;
and added again, Eat, and be not ashamed.&mdash;O my master, replied my
brother, I have had enough, and have not power to eat anything
more:&mdash;but the host rejoined, If thou desire, O my guest, to eat more,
and to delight thyself with extraordinary dainties, by Allah! by Allah!
remain not hungry.</p>

<p>My brother now reflected upon his situation, and upon the manner
in which this man was jesting with him, and said within himself, By
Allah, I will do to him a deed that shall make him repent before God
of these actions! The man of the house next said to his attendants,
Bring us the wine:&mdash;and, as before, they made the same motions with
their hands in the air as if they were doing what he commanded; after
which he pretended to hand to my brother a cup, saying, Take this
cup, for it will delight thee:&mdash;and his guest replied, O my master, this
is of thy bounty:&mdash;and he acted with his hand as though he were
drinking it.&mdash;Hath it pleased thee? said the host.&mdash;O my master,
answered my brother, I have never seen anything more delicious than
this wine.&mdash;Drink then, rejoined the master of the house, and may it
be attended with benefit and health:&mdash;and he himself pretended to
drink, and to hand a second cup to my brother, who, after he had
affected to drink it, feigned himself intoxicated, and, taking his host
unawares, raised his hand until the whiteness of his arm-pit appeared,
and struck him such a slap upon his neck that the chamber rang at
the blow; and this he followed by a second blow; whereupon the man
exclaimed, What is this, thou vilest of the creation?&mdash;O my master,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
answered my brother, I am thy slave, whom thou hast graciously
admitted into thine abode, and thou hast fed him with thy provisions,
and treated him with old wine, and he hath become intoxicated, and
committed an outrage upon thee; but thou art of too exalted dignity
to be angry with him for his ignorance.</p>

<p>When the master of the house heard these words of my brother,
he uttered a loud laugh, and said to him, Verily for a long time have
I made game of men, and jested with all persons accustomed to joking
and rudeness, but I have not seen among them any who could endure
this trick, nor any who had sagacity to conform to all my actions,
except thee: now, therefore, I pardon thee; and be thou my companion
in reality, and never relinquish me. He then gave orders to
bring a number of the dishes above mentioned, and he and my
brother ate together to satisfaction; after which they removed to the
drinking-chamber, where female slaves like so many moons sang all
kinds of melodies, and played on all kinds of musical instruments.
There they drank until intoxication overcame them: the master of the
house treated my brother as a familiar friend, became greatly attached
to him, and clad him with a costly dress; and on the following morning
they resumed their feasting and drinking. Thus they continued
to live for a period of twenty years: the man then died, and the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n<a href="#V101" class="fnanchor">101</a> seized upon his property, and took possession of it.</p>

<p>My brother, upon this, went forth from the city, a fugitive; and
upon his way, a party of Arabs<a href="#V102" class="fnanchor">102</a> came upon him. They made him
a captive; and the man who captured him tortured him with beating,
and said to him, By Allah, purchase thyself of me by wealth, or I will
kill thee:&mdash;but my brother, weeping, replied, By Allah, I possess
nothing, O Sheykh of the Arabs; nor do I know the means of
obtaining any property: I am thy captive; I have fallen into thy
hands, and do with me what thou wilt. And immediately the
tyrannical Bedawee drew forth from his girdle a broad-bladed knife
(such as, if plunged into the neck of a camel, would cut it across from
one jugular vein to the other), and, taking it in his right hand,
approached my poor brother, and cut off with it his lips; still urging
his demand.&mdash;Now this Bedawee had a handsome wife, who, when he
was absent, used to manifest a strong affection for my brother;
though he observed a proper decorum towards her, fearing God (whose
name be exalted!); and it happened, one day, that she had called
him, and seated him with her; but while they were together, lo, her
husband came in upon them; and when he beheld my brother, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
exclaimed, Wo to thee, thou base wretch! Dost thou desire now to
corrupt my wife?&mdash;Then drawing his knife, he inflicted upon him
another cruel wound; after which he mounted him upon a camel, and,
having cast him upon a mountain, left him there, and went his way.
Some travellers, however, passed by him, and when they discovered
him, they gave him food and drink, and acquainted me with his case:
so I went forth to him, and conveyed him back into the city, and
allotted him a sufficient maintenance.</p>

<p>Now I have come unto thee, O Prince of the Faithful, continued
the barber, and feared to return to my house without relating to thee
these facts; for to neglect doing so had been an error. Thus thou
hast seen that, although having six brothers, I am of a more upright
character than they.&mdash;But when the Prince of the Faithful had heard
my story, and all that I had related to him respecting my brothers, he
laughed, and said, Thou hast spoken truth, O &#7778;&aacute;mit (O silent man);
thou art a person of few words, and devoid of impertinence; now,
however, depart from this city, and take up thine abode in another.
So he banished me from Baghd&aacute;d; and I journeyed through various
countries, and traversed many regions, until I heard of his death, and
of the succession of another Khaleefeh; when, returning to my city,
I met with this young man, unto whom I did the best of deeds, and
who, had it not been for me, had been slain: yet he hath accused me
of that which is not in my character; for all that he hath related of
me, with respect to impertinence, and loquacity, and dulness, and want
of taste, is false, O people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span></p>

<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE STORY TOLD BY THE TAILOR.</h5>

<p>The tailor then proceeded thus:&mdash;When we heard the story of the
barber, and were convinced of his impertinence and loquacity, and
that the young man had been treated unjustly by him, we seized hold
upon him, and put him in confinement, and, seating ourselves to keep
watch over him, ate and drank; and the feast was finished in the
most agreeable manner. We remained sitting together until the call
to afternoon-prayers, when I went forth, and returned to my house;
but my wife looked angrily at me, and said, Thou hast been all the
day enjoying thy pleasure while I have been sitting at home sorrowful;
now if thou go not forth with me and amuse me for the remainder
of the day, thy refusal will be the cause of my separation from thee.
So I took her and went out with her, and we amused ourselves until
nightfall, when, returning home, we met this humpback, full of drink,
and repeating verses; upon which I invited him to come home with
us, and he consented. I then went forth to buy some fried fish, and
having bought it and returned, we sat down to eat; and my wife took a
morsel of bread and a piece of fish, and put them into his mouth, and
choked him, so that he died; whereupon I took him up, and contrived
to throw him into the house of this physician, and he contrived to throw
him into the house of the steward, and the steward contrived to throw
him in the way of the broker.&mdash;This is the story of what happened to
me yesterday. Is it not more wonderful than that of the humpback?</p>

<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF THE HUMPBACK.</h5>

<p>When the King had heard this story, he ordered certain of his
chamberlains to go with the tailor, and to bring the barber; saying to
them, His presence is indispensable, that I may hear his talk, and it
may be the cause of the deliverance of you all: then we will bury this
humpback decently in the earth, for he hath been dead since yesterday;
and we will make him a monument around his grave, since he
hath been the occasion of our acquaintance with these wonderful stories.</p>

<p>The chamberlains and the tailor soon came back, after having
gone to the place of confinement and brought the barber, whom they
placed before the King; and when the King beheld him, he saw him
to be an old man, passed his ninetieth year, of dark countenance, and
white beard and eyebrows, with small ears, and long nose, and a
haughty aspect. The King laughed at the sight of him, and said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
him, O silent man, I desire that thou relate to me somewhat of thy
stories.&mdash;O King of the age, replied the barber, what is the occasion
of the presence of this Christian and this Jew and this Muslim, and
this humpback lying dead among you; and what is the reason of this
assembly?&mdash;Wherefore dost thou ask this? said the King. The
barber answered, I ask it in order that the King may know me to be
no impertinent person, nor one who meddleth with that which doth
not concern him, and that I am free from the loquacity of which they
accuse me: for I am fortunate in my characteristic appellation, since
they have surnamed me E&#7779;-&#7778;&aacute;mit; and, as the poet hath said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Seldom hast thou seen a person honoured with a surname, but thou wilt find, if
thou search, that his character is expressed by it.</p></div>

<p>The King therefore said, Explain to the barber the case of this humpback,
and what happened to him yesterday evening, and explain to
him also what the Christian hath related, and the Jew and the steward
and the tailor. So they repeated to him the stories of all these persons.</p>

<p>The barber, thereupon, shook his head, saying, By Allah, this
is a wonderful thing! Uncover this humpback, that I may examine
him.&mdash;And they did so. He then seated himself at his head, and,
taking it up, placed it upon his lap, and looked at his face, and
laughed so violently that he fell backwards, exclaiming, For every
death there is a cause; and the death of this humpback is most
wonderful: it is worthy of being registered in the records, that
posterity may be instructed by this event!&mdash;The King, astonished at
his words, said, O &#7778;&aacute;mit, explain to us the reason of thy saying this.&mdash;O
King, replied the barber, by thy beneficence, life is yet in the
humpback! He then drew forth from his bosom a pot containing
some ointment, and with this he anointed the neck of the humpback;
after which he covered it up until it perspired; when he took forth an
iron forceps, and put it down his throat, and extracted the piece of fish
with its bone, and all the people saw them. The humpback now
sprang upon his feet, and sneezed, and, recovering his consciousness,
drew his hands over his face, and exclaimed, There is no Deity but
God! Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle! God bless and save him!&mdash;and
all who were present were astonished at the sight, and the King
laughed until he became insensible; as did also the other spectators.
The King exclaimed, By Allah, this accident is wonderful! I have
never witnessed anything more strange!&mdash;and added, O Muslims! O
assembly of soldiers! have ye ever in the course of your lives seen any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
one die and after that come to life? But had not God blessed him
with this barber, the humpback had been to-day numbered among
the people of the other world; for the barber hath been the means of
restoring him to life.&mdash;They replied, This is indeed a wonderful thing!</p>

<p>The King then gave orders to record this event; and when they
had done so, he placed the record in the royal library; and he bestowed
dresses of honour upon the Jew and the Christian and the steward;
upon each of them, a costly dress: the tailor he appointed to be his
own tailor, granting him regular allowances, and reconciling him and
the humpback with each other: the humpback he honoured with a rich
and beautiful dress, and with similar allowances, and appointed him his
cup-companion; and upon the barber also he conferred the like favours,
rewarding him with a costly dress of honour, regular allowances, and a
fixed salary, and appointing him state-barber, and his own cup-companion:
so they all lived in the utmost happiness and comfort until they
were visited by the terminator of delights and the separator of friends.</p>

<h5>NOTES TO CHAPTER FIFTH.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V1" id="V1">1.</a></span> As the story of the Humpback is one of the best in this collection, and
purely Arab, I have been glad to find, in the Calcutta edition of the first two
hundred nights, authority for deviating here from my usual standard copy, by substituting
"El-Ba&#7779;rah" for a city of China. The Breslau edition, in the opening of the
story, lays the scene at "El-Ba&#7779;rah <i>and</i> &#7730;aj&#7731;&aacute;r." By the latter, I suppose K&aacute;shghar
to be meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V2" id="V2">2.</a></span> In my original, they are said to have gone out early in the morning; but
this is contradicted by the sequel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V3" id="V3">3.</a></span> The appeal to Ezra's ass, which alludes to a tradition believed by the
Muslims, as it is mentioned in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, is omitted in the Cairo edition. The story
is this:&mdash;'Ozeyr, or Ezra, "riding on an ass by the ruins of Jerusalem, after it had been
destroyed by the Chaldeans, doubted in his mind by what means God could raise the
city and its inhabitants again; whereupon God caused him to die, and he remained in
that condition a hundred years; at the end of which, God restored him to life, and he
found a basket of figs and a cruise of wine that he had with him, not in the least
spoiled or corrupted; but his ass was dead, the bones only remaining; and these, while
the Prophet looked on, were raised and clothed with flesh, becoming an ass again,
which, being inspired with life, began immediately to bray."<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V4" id="V4">4.</a></span> Most Arab cities abound with cats, which are much favoured by the inhabitants.
These animals are often seen leaping across from the terrace of one house
to that of another on the opposite side of a narrow street; and often has my kitchen in
Cairo been robbed by them. They are said to contribute greatly to the spreading of
the plague.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V5" id="V5">5.</a></span> Occurrences of this kind are said to have often happened in Arab towns,
where dogs, though esteemed unclean by the Muslims, are, like cats, generally very numerous.
Few of them have masters; but they compose distinct tribes; those of each
tribe confining themselves to a particular quarter or district of the town, and suffering
no strange dog to intrude among them and share with them in the offal thrown out
from the butchers' shops and from private houses; or prowling about the mounds of
rubbish in the environs, and, like the vultures, feeding upon the carcasses of camels,
asses, and other beasts, thrown out by the inhabitants. I was once told that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>master of an English merchant-vessel, having fallen asleep in a state of intoxication on
the shore of the harbour of Alexandria, at night, was devoured by dogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V6" id="V6">6.</a></span> The snatching of turbans by night is still a frequent practice of Arab
rogues, and one which is often very lucrative; many a turban being composed of a costly
Kashmeer shawl wound round a &#7789;arboosh, which latter alone is worth eight or nine
shillings, or more, and some also having money or other valuables secreted in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V7" id="V7">7.</a></span> Watchmen are generally employed to guard by night the soo&#7731;s, or
market-streets, and other districts, in Arab towns. Those in Cairo carry a nebboot, or
long staff, but no lantern. Their usual cries are of a religious nature; as, "I extol
the perfection of the Living King, who sleepeth not nor dieth!" When they see a
passenger approaching, they call out to him, "Attest the unity of God!" or merely,
"Attest the unity!" and the reply is, "There is no deity but God!" It is supposed
that a person bound on any unlawful undertaking would not dare to utter these words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V8" id="V8">8.</a></span> At the period when this work was composed, the Christians were distinguished
from the Muslims by a black or blue turban, and this was wound in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V9" id="V9">9.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Title and Office of</i> W&aacute;lee. "W&aacute;lee" is the title given to the chief
magistrate of the police, and was so employed in the time of El-Ma&#7731;reezee, instead of
the older appellation of "&#7778;&aacute;&#7717;eb esh-Shur&#7789;ah." The same officer was also called
"Mutawellee." It was the duty of this magistrate to perambulate the streets at night,
attended by a body of his officers, including an executioner; for he often inflicted
capital punishment on criminals immediately after their detection. He was invested
with a degree of despotic power, and often put to death persons accused of capital
crimes without the formalities required by the law. It was also his duty to superintend
the infliction of the punishments of criminals legally condemned. An officer
was employed to perform the nightly rounds in El-Medeeneh in the reign of Aboo-Bekr;
but it appears that the first regular guard for this purpose was appointed in the
reign of 'Othm&aacute;n.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V10" id="V10">10.</a></span> The ardebb, thus commonly pronounced, but properly written irdebb,
varies in different places. In Cairo it is very nearly equivalent to five English
bushels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V11" id="V11">11.</a></span> In the original, this building is called the Kh&aacute;n of El-Jaw&aacute;lee; but it
evidently should be &mdash;&mdash; of El-J&aacute;walee; and the error is to be attributed to a copyist.
The Kh&aacute;n of El-J&aacute;walee is mentioned by El-Ma&#7731;reezee,<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> as being situate at a short
distance within the present gate called B&aacute;b en-Na&#7779;r, and by the site of the older gate
so called; and as existing in his time, in the former half of the ninth century of the
Flight. [El-Ma&#7731;reezee also informs us, in his account of the Medreseh el-J&aacute;waleeyeh,
that El-J&aacute;walee's full name was 'Alam-ed-Deen Senjer, and that he was originally a
memlook of one J&aacute;walee (whence his surname), an Emeer of El-Melik e&#7827;-&#7826;&aacute;hir
Beybars. He died in the year of the Flight 745.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V12" id="V12">12.</a></span> B&aacute;b en-Na&#7779;r (the Gate of Victory, or &mdash;&mdash; of Aid) is the name of the
easternmost of the northern gates of Cairo. It was built in the reign of the Khaleefeh
El-Mustan&#7779;ir, in the year of the Flight 480 (<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1087-8).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V13" id="V13">13.</a></span> The words "besides my brokerage," I have inserted as necessary to make
the account correct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V15" id="V15">15.</a></span> As it is held impolite to shew the hands, unless unavoidably, in the
presence of a person of rank, the sleeve of the cloth coat, or that of the silk vest which
is worn beneath it, is made sufficiently long to extend a little beyond the ends of the
fingers; and so also, in general, is the sleeve of the shirt worn by persons of the lower
orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V16" id="V16">16.</a></span> This building is first called, in the Cairo edition, the Kh&aacute;n of Suroor;
and afterwards, &mdash;&mdash; of Mesroor: the latter is the appellation given to it in the edition
of Breslau; and is the correct name. The Kh&aacute;n of Mesroor is mentioned by El-Ma&#7731;reezee,<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>
as situate at the southern extremity of Beyn el-&#7730;a&#7779;reyn (respecting
which see the next note), adjacent to the site of the Great Palace of the Khaleefehs.
There were two Kh&aacute;ns of this name near each other. El-Ma&#7731;reezee says, that, in his
earlier days, the greater of these, which appears to be that here alluded to, was one of
the finest and largest Kh&aacute;ns in Cairo, in a most flourishing state, the resort of the
chief Syrian merchants, and the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t of their goods; but that latterly it had declined,
and some portions of it were ruined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V17" id="V17">17.</a></span> Beyn el-&#7730;a&#7779;reyn (which signifies "Between the Two Palaces") is the
name still applied to that part of the principal street of Cairo which intervenes between
the sites of the two famous palaces of the Khaleefehs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V18" id="V18">18.</a></span> A &#7730;eys&aacute;reeyeh is a superior kind of soo&#7731;, consisting of ranges of shops
facing each other. That which is here mentioned (called in the Cairo edition, the
&#7730;eysereeyeh of Jirjis; in the edition of Breslau, the &#7730;eys&aacute;reeyeh of Jarkash; and in
the old English version, erroneously, the Circassian bezestein) is the &#7730;eys&aacute;reeyeh of
Jah&aacute;rkas, which, as I learn from El-Ma&#7731;reezee,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> was situate near the centre of what
constituted the old city, on the east of the principal street. It existed in his time, and
was built by the Emeer Fakhr-ed-Deen Jah&aacute;rkas, in the year of the Flight 502 (A.D.
1108-9). Ibn-Khallik&aacute;n,<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> as quoted by El-Ma&#7731;reezee, says of it, "I have seen a
number of merchants who have traversed various countries, and who say, 'We have
not seen in any country its equal in beauty and greatness, and compactness of construction.'"
He explains also the orthography of the name of "Jah&aacute;rkas," and states
that it is Persian (Chah&aacute;r-kas), and signifies "four persons."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V19" id="V19">19.</a></span> The Egyptian fowls are much smaller than those of our country, and
one is not too much for one man's breakfast. The eggs are usually hatched in ovens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V20" id="V20">20.</a></span> The appellation of "the Gardener" is here to be understood as a mere
surname derived from the occupation of some ancestor of the merchant; it being a
common custom of the Arabs to retain an appellation of this kind, however humble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V21" id="V21">21.</a></span> El-Ma&#7731;reezee<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> mentions a "soo&#7731; of the money-changers" as near to the
Kh&aacute;n of Mesroor; and it seems to be the place here alluded to: the word "soo&#7731;"
being often omitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V22" id="V22">22.</a></span> The lady having offered up a prayer that the young merchant might be
her husband, I have taken the liberty of inserting here a slight interpolation, which
does not detract from the probability or consistency of the story; but rather the
contrary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V23" id="V23">23.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On one of the Passages in this Work indicating a very late Date.</i> The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>&#7716;abb&aacute;neeyeh is the name now applied to a portion of a main street, a little to the
west of the lake called Birket el-Feel, in the southern part of Cairo. It is evidently
thus applied in the passage to which this note relates; but El-Ma&#7731;reezee, writing in
the former half of the ninth century of the Flight,<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> says, "In this our time, bordering
upon it [the Birket el-Feel] is a <i>garden</i> called by the name of the &#7716;abb&aacute;neeyeh, who
were a family of Darm&agrave; the son of 'Amr the son of 'Owf the son of Tha&#7841;lebeh the son
of Ba&#7841;l the son of 'Amr the son of El-Gh&oacute;th the son of &#7788;eiyi: so Darm&agrave; was a minor
family of [the tribe of] &#7788;eiyi, and the &#7716;abb&aacute;neeyoon [or &#7716;abb&aacute;neeyeh&mdash;for the terms
are synonymous] were a family of Darm&agrave;; and the people have made a road between
the garden of the &#7716;abb&aacute;neeyeh and the lake." He proceeds to say, that on the <i>east</i> of
the Birket el-Feel there <i>were</i> gardens; but that <i>houses</i> and <i>streets</i> had been built <i>there</i>.&mdash;Now,
in the work before us, the tract which was a <i>garden</i> in the time of El-Ma&#7731;reezee
is mentioned as occupied by <i>houses</i> and <i>streets</i>. Many years must have elapsed since
that period before such could have been the case; and surely at least a century before
the houses could have presented such an appearance as would lead a writer to imagine
them of "ancient times." It may be objected against an argument drawn from this
passage, that it is perhaps an interpolation of a copyist; but it agrees with many
evidences of a late date, and occurs in at least one other copy (that from which the
Breslau edition is printed), with only this slight difference&mdash;that "&#7716;abb&aacute;neeyeh," by
the erroneous addition of a point beneath the first letter, is converted into "Jebb&aacute;neeyeh;"
and it should be remarked that the latter copy varies considerably in other
points from that of Cairo. It would imply that Cairo was almost as extensive a city at
the time when this work was composed or modernized as it is at present; and would
account for its being here called Mi&#7779;r, or Ma&#7779;r; a name which was retained by El-Fus&#7789;&aacute;&#7789;
at least as late as the commencement of the tenth century of the Flight, and
probably until the year 1517 of our era or a little later, as I have remarked in a former
note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V24" id="V24">24.</a></span> "&#7730;&aacute;'ah" is a term generally signifying "a lofty saloon;" but also often
applied to an elegant house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V25" id="V25">25.</a></span> "Na&#7731;eeb" signifies "a chief," "a leader," &amp;c., and has various applications.
In the present instance, the office which it designates is doubtful, but is
evidently of high dignity, as Na&#7731;eeb of the Shereefs, the Chief, or Syndic, of the
Descendants of the Prophet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V26" id="V26">26.</a></span> B&aacute;b Zuweyleh (the Gate of Zuweyleh, or, more properly, of Zaweeleh,
which is the name of a tribe) is a gate that was built at the same period as B&aacute;b en-Na&#7779;r,
before mentioned. It marked the southern limit of Cairo; but is now in the
heart of the metropolis. With two round-fronted towers, each surmounted by a lofty
and elegant m&aacute;d'neh, or menaret, pertaining to the adjoining great mosque of El-Mueiyad,
it presents a very noble appearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V27" id="V27">27.</a></span> "Imperial gypsum" is a name given to the best kind of plaster used in
Cairo. I have often admired the smoothness of its surface upon the walls of chambers
in some of the older houses in that city; but, I need hardly say, never saw any that
reflected like a mirror.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V28" id="V28">28.</a></span> In the Cairo edition, "with pearls and jewels at its corners." The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>deficiency I have supplied from the edition of Breslau: but I may here remark, that it
would have been more proper to describe the snakes as <i>gilt</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V29" id="V29">29.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Crowns worn by Arab Ladies.</i> From Eastern drawings and
descriptions, it appears that the kind of crown here mentioned was generally a circle of
jewelled gold (the lower edge of which was straight; and the upper, fancifully
heightened to four or more points) surrounding the lower part of a dome-shaped cap
with a jewel or some other ornament at the summit. This crown was worn by many
Arab ladies of high rank or great wealth, probably until about two centuries ago.
Another kind of crown is now more generally worn, called a "&#7731;ur&#7779;." This is a round,
convex ornament, generally about five inches in diameter, composed of gold set with a
profusion of diamonds, of open work, representing roses, leaves, &amp;c. It is sewed upon
the top of the &#7789;arboosh; and is worn by most of the ladies of Cairo, at least in full dress.
An engraving of a crown of this description, and another of one of a more common kind,
may be seen in my work on the Modern Egyptians, vol. ii. Appendix A.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V30" id="V30">30.</a></span> It is a common custom of the Arabs to give a present of money tied up in
a corner of an embroidered handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V31" id="V31">31.</a></span> The mace is a weapon still used in the East; but not so commonly as it
was in former times. There was a petty governor in Upper Egypt during my first visit
to that country, who, in his daily rides, indulged a frequent habit of striking persons
with a weapon of this kind, a tolerably-heavy steel mace; but he did it with a happy
knack, so as never, I believe, to inflict a dangerous wound, unless intentionally. Maces,
like other arms of steel, are often tastefully inlaid with arabesque ornaments and inscriptions
in gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V32" id="V32">32.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Punishment of Theft.</i> The Mohammadan law ordains that a person
who is adult and of sound mind, if he steals an article of the value of a quarter of a
deen&aacute;r (or piece of gold) from a place to which he has not ordinary or free access, shall
lose his right hand; but this punishment is not to be inflicted for stealing a free child,
or anything which, in the eye of the law, is of no pecuniary value; as wine, or a musical
instrument; and there are some other cases in which the thief is not to be so punished.
For the second offence, the left foot is to be cut off; and for the third and subsequent
offences, according to the &#7716;anafee code, the culprit is to be punished by a long imprisonment;
or, by the Sh&aacute;fe'ee law, for the third offence, he is to lose his left hand; for
the fourth, his right foot; and for further offences, he is to be flogged or beaten. The
punishment is the same for a woman as for a man.&mdash;This law induced a freethinking
Muslim to ask, "If the hand is worth five hundred deen&aacute;rs, [this being the fine for
depriving a man of that member,] why should it be cut off for a quarter of a deen&aacute;r?"
He was answered, "An honest hand is of great value; but not so is the hand that hath
stolen."&mdash;Amputation for theft is now seldom practised: beating, or some other punishment,
is usually inflicted in its stead for the first, second, and third offence; and, frequently,
death for the fourth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V33" id="V33">33.</a></span> Capital punishment in this case would be contrary to the law; but it is
often inflicted upon highway-robbers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V34" id="V34">34.</a></span> The meaning is, that the doer is God. An allusion is here conveyed to a
verse (the 17th) in the Soorat el-Anf&aacute;l (the eighth chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n)&mdash;"Thou didst
not cast [the gravel into their eyes] when thou didst [seem to] cast [it]; but God cast
[it]."<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

The most approved and common mode of entertaining guests at modern private
festivities among the Arabs is by a Khatmeh, which is the recitation of the whole of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n. Three or more persons of the inferior class of the professors of religion and
law, who are called fa&#7731;eehs (vulgarly, fi&#7731;ees), are usually hired for this purpose. Schoolmasters,
and students of the collegiate mosques who devote themselves to religion and
law, are the persons most commonly thus employed. Their mode of recitation is a
peculiar kind of chanting,<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> which, when well executed, I found very agreeable, at least
for an hour or so: but the guests seldom have to listen to the chanting of the whole of
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n: the reciters usually accomplish the greater portion of their task, in a
somewhat hurried manner, before the guests have assembled, each of them chanting, in
turn, a certain portion, as a thirtieth part of the whole (called a "juz"), or half of one
of these sections (a "&#7717;ezb"), or, more commonly, a quarter (rub&#7841;). Afterwards they
chant more leisurely, and in a more musical manner; but still by turns.&mdash;These recitations
of the whole of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n are performed on various festive occasions, but are
most usual after a death; the merit of the performance being transferred to the soul
of the deceased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V39" id="V39">39.</a></span> The mess termed "zirb&aacute;jeh," by some called "zurb&aacute;jeh," from the

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V40" id="V40">40.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Atonements and other Services for the Dead.</i> As filial piety is a general
characteristic of the Arabs, and various services are believed by them to atone for the
minor sins of the deceased, and thus to diminish his misery, or to increase his happiness,
it is natural, and not uncommon, for a son to act in the manner here related. Recitations
of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n are performed for the dead, to whom the merit of these works is
transferred, and a sacrifice is often offered at the tomb after the burial; the flesh of the
victim being distributed to the poor. But a more important service for the deceased is
the payment of his debts; for it is affirmed by the Prophet, that even martyrdom will
not atone for a debt unpaid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V41" id="V41">41.</a></span> A money-changer is very frequently employed to examine the money
which a purchaser offers; and if it be old, to weigh it. The money-changers are mostly
Jews and Christians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V42" id="V42">42.</a></span> Some mosques (as the Azhar, for instance, the principal mosque of Cairo)
remain open all night; and many houseless persons sleep in them, upon the matting
which covers the paved floor. Men are also often seen, at other times, but not at the
hours of prayer, lounging, eating, or working, in the mosques; such practices not being
deemed inconsistent with the high respect which the Muslims pay to these buildings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V43" id="V43">43.</a></span> The remainder of this paragraph, and the whole of the next two paragraphs,
being omitted in the edition of Cairo, I translate from the Calcutta edition of
the first two hundred nights, and the edition of Breslau; but almost entirely from the
former.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V44" id="V44">44.</a></span> The water of the well of Zemzem, in the temple of Mekkeh, is believed
to possess miraculous virtues, and is therefore brought away in bottles or flasks by many
of the pilgrims, to be used when occasion may require as medicine, or to be sprinkled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>on grave-linen. A bottle of it is a common and acceptable present from a pilgrim, and
a guest is sometimes treated with a sip of this holy water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V45" id="V45">45.</a></span> A whip is sometimes used in the &#7717;areem of a great man; and its being
attached to the waist of the damsel here mentioned marks her authority. It is generally
formed of a strip of hippopotamus' hide, hammered into a round shape; and this kind
is called a "kurb&aacute;j." I believe it is seldom used in the &#7717;areem with severity; but
usually for intimidation. [I once saw some of the ladies of N&aacute;zlee Kh&aacute;nim (thus vulgarly
pronounced for N&aacute;zloo Kh&aacute;num) struck with a kurb&aacute;j, for too curiously looking
in at the window of an apartment in that lady's palace, in which I and some friends
happened to be, and which overlooked the private garden. They were speedily driven
away by two or three black eunuchs, who appeared to use their heavy whips indiscriminately
and severely; their excuse for this conduct undoubtedly being, that these
ladies were guilty of a great impropriety in thus shewing themselves to men; for when
riding abroad, it is usual for passengers in the streets to turn their faces to the wall on
the approach of the women of a great man's household. Moreover, the &#7717;areem of N&aacute;zlee
Kh&aacute;nim was well known to be ruled with an iron hand, and its mistress herself to
have acquired the character of her brutal husband, Mo&#7717;ammad Bey, the Defterd&aacute;r,
whose cruelties are mentioned in the "Modern Egyptians."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V46" id="V46">46.</a></span> It is a universal custom of the Arabs, on visiting the sick, to say, "May

El-Weleed the son of 'Abd-El-Melik, in the eighty-eighth year of the Flight (a. d.
706-7). The Arabs would deprive St. Ephrem Syrus of the honour of having been the
author of the first institution of this kind; one of their historians ascribing it to an early
Pharaoh, named Men&aacute;&#7731;iyoosh; another, to Hippocrates.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V49" id="V49">49.</a></span> "The metropolis of the world," or literally, "the mother of the world"
("umm ed-duny&agrave;"), is a title given to several cities, as well as to Cairo, by their respective
inhabitants. This passage, therefore, and others of a similar kind, in which
even <i>foreigners</i> are made to rank Egypt and Cairo as superior to every other country
and city, strongly favour the opinion that some of its tales were written, or altered, by
an Egyptian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V50" id="V50">50.</a></span> A more ample eulogium upon Egypt and the Nile, but abounding with
such gross errors that I could not confidently offer a translation, is found in the Breslau
edition. It agrees better with the old translation; which, however, in this place,
presents considerable unauthorized amplifications, and some misconceptions: "Birket
el-&#7716;abash" (for instance), the name of a lake on the south of Cairo, being mistaken for
Ethiopia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V53" id="V53">53.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Retaliation and Fines for Wounds and Mutilations.</i> Retaliation for
intentional wounds and mutilations is allowed by the Mohammadan law, like as for
murder; "eye for eye," &amp;c.:<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> but a fine may be accepted instead, which the law allows
also for unintentional injuries. The fine for a member that is single (as the nose) is the
whole price of blood, as for homicide; namely a thousand deen&aacute;rs (about 500<i>l.</i>) from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>him who possesses gold; or, from him who possesses silver, twelve thousand dirhems
(about 300<i>l.</i>); for a member of which there are two, and not more (as a hand), half the
price of blood; for one of which there are ten (a finger or toe), a tenth of the price of
blood: but the fine of a man for maiming or wounding a woman is half of that for the
same injury to a man; and that of a free person for injuring a slave varies according to
the value of the slave. The fine for depriving a man of any of his five senses, or
dangerously wounding him, or grievously disfiguring him for life, is the whole price of
blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V54" id="V54">54.</a></span> See No. 20 of the notes to Chapter ii.&mdash;"The women of Egypt have the

I need do in the present case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V55" id="V55">55.</a></span> The Arabs are generally of opinion that the innate dispositions of a child
are inherited more from the mother than from the father. They believe that a daughter
commonly resembles, in good or evil qualities, her mother; and a son, his maternal
uncle. Hence they often address a man, "Y&aacute; &#7789;eiyib el-kh&aacute;l!"&mdash;"O thou who hast a
good maternal uncle!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V56" id="V56">56.</a></span> 'Abd-Allah Ibn-'Abb&aacute;s was one of the most learned of the companions of
his cousin Mo&#7717;ammad, and one of the most celebrated of the relaters of his sayings and
actions. He has received the titles of "Interpreter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n" and "Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of
Commentators." He died in the year of the Flight 68. His father, 'Abb&aacute;s, the son of
'Abd-El-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib, was paternal uncle of Mo&#7717;ammad, and ancestor of the 'Abb&aacute;see
Khaleefehs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V57" id="V57">57.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Astrolabe.</i> The astrolabe is more commonly used by the Arabs
than any other instrument for astronomical observations. It is generally between four
and six inches in diameter. It consists of a circular plate with a graduated rim, within
which fit several thinner plates, and of a limb, moving on a pivot in the centre, with
two sights. The plates are engraved with complicated diagrams, &amp;c., for various calculations.
The instrument is held by a ring, or by a loop of cord attached to the ring,
during an observation; and thus its own weight answers the same purpose as the
plumb-line of the quadrant (which the Arabs sometimes use in its stead); the position
of the moveable limb with the sights marking the required altitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V58" id="V58">58.</a></span> &#7778;afar is the second mouth of the Mohammadan year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V59" id="V59">59.</a></span> As different copies vary here as to the date, I have taken the liberty of
putting 263 instead of 763 or 653, in order to avoid a glaring anachronism. It is probable,
however, that the last of these is the author's date, as it is found both in the old
translation, and in the Breslau edition. The date in the Cairo edition is 763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V60" id="V60">60.</a></span> A degree is four minutes; it would have been more proper, therefore, to

Ya&#7731;ya&#7731;), signify "Chatterer." "El-Kooz el-A&#7779;w&aacute;nee" (not to be mistaken for
"&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Asw&aacute;nee," with a <i>soft</i> s) seems to imply that the person thus named was
always like a mug, with open mouth, and insensible as flint to rebuke. The two remaining
names are different in different copies: "Sha&#7731;&aacute;li&#7731;" is perhaps put erroneously
for some other word, as "Shi&#7731;&aacute;&#7731;," "Discord."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V69" id="V69">69.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Congregational Friday-prayers.</i> The Sel&aacute;m (or Salutation) of Friday
is a form of blessing on the Prophet and his family and companions, which is chanted by
the mu&euml;ddins from the m&aacute;d'nehs (or towers) of the congregational mosques half an hour
before noon. The worshippers begin to assemble in the mosque as soon as they hear it,
and, ranging themselves in rows parallel to, and facing, that side in which is the niche,
that marks the direction of Mekkeh, each performs, by himself, the prayers of two
rek'ahs, which are supererogatory, and then sits in his place while a reader recites part or
the whole of the 18th chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n. At the call of noon, they all stand up, and
each again performs, separately, the prayers of two rek'ahs, ordained by the Prophet.
A minister, standing at the foot of the pulpit-stairs, then proposes to bless the Prophet:
and accordingly, a second Sel&aacute;m is chanted by one or more other ministers stationed on
an elevated platform. After this, the former minister, and the latter after him, repeat
the call of noon (which the mu&euml;ddins have before chanted from the m&aacute;d'nehs); and the
former enjoins silence. The chief minister (Kha&#7789;eeb, or Im&aacute;m,) has already seated himself
on the top step or platform of the pulpit. He now rises, and recites a khu&#7789;beh of
praise to God and exhortation to the congregation; and if in a country or town acquired
by arms from unbelievers, he holds a wooden sword, resting its point on the ground.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>
Each of the congregation next offers up some private supplication; after which, the
Kha&#7789;eeb recites a second khu&#7789;beh, which is always the same, or nearly so; part, of a
similar nature to the first, but chiefly, prayer for the Prophet and his family, &amp;c., and
for the general welfare of the Muslims. This finished, the Kha&#7789;eeb or Im&aacute;m descends
from the pulpit, and, stationed before the niche, after a form of words<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> differing slightly
from the call to prayer has been chanted by the ministers on the elevated platform
before mentioned, recites the divinely-ordained prayers of Friday (two rek'ahs), while
the people do the same silently, keeping time with him exactly in the various postures.
Thus are completed the Friday-prayers; but some of the congregation remain, and
perform the ordinary divinely-ordained prayers of noon.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V70" id="V70">70.</a></span> So in the Cairo edition. El-Munta&#7779;ir bi-ll&aacute;h was the great-grandson of
H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed, and acceded to the throne in the year of the Flight 247 (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
861). A slight anachronism, therefore, is here presented, unless we suppose that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>hero of the story told by the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n's steward was an old man at the period of the misfortune
of the humpback. The reign of El-Munta&#7779;ir was somewhat less than six
months. The copy from which the old translation was made, and the edition of Breslau,
date the adventure of the barber, here related, more than three centuries and a half

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V74" id="V74">74.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Augurations with respect to Marriage.</i> This passage alludes to an
astrological calculation made with the view of determining by what sign of the zodiac
the two persons are influenced who contemplate becoming man and wife, and thence
ascertaining whether they will agree. This is often done in the present day by adding
together the numerical values of the letters composing his or her name and that of the
mother, and, if I remember right, subtracting from 12 the whole sum if this is less than
12, or what remains after subtracting, or dividing by, 12. Thus is obtained the
number of the sign. The twelve signs, commencing with Aries, correspond respectively
with the elements of fire, earth, air, water, fire, earth, and so on; and if the signs of
the two parties indicate the same element, it is inferred that they will agree; but if
they indicate different elements, the inference is, that the one will be affected by the
other in the same manner as the element of the one is by that of the other: thus, if the
element of the man is fire, and that of the woman, water, he will be subject to her rule.</p>

<p>Among other calculations of the same kind is the following, which my sheykh has
mentioned in a marginal note on this passage, in the copy from which I translate.&mdash;The
numerical values of the letters composing the name of each of the two parties are
added together, and one of these two sums is subtracted from the other: if the remainder
is an uneven number, the inference is unfavourable; but if even, the reverse.</p>

<p>In the present instance, the dupe, knowing that there are various modes of divining
whether he will be happy with his wife, is made to believe that his fortune depends
upon the mode, instead of the result, of the calculation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V75" id="V75">75.</a></span> Here, in my original, "Ba&#7731;ba&#7731;;" but this, as before mentioned, was the

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V76" id="V76">76.</a></span> "&#7730;uffeh," signifying "a basket of palm-leaves," and "a dry gourd,"
seems to be here equivalent to "empty-head."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V77" id="V77">77.</a></span> The blind in Egypt are notorious for their impudence.&mdash;It is related
that Moses, while bathing one day in the Nile, saw a blind man pass by, and, being
moved with pity, prayed that God would restore his sight. His prayer was answered;
but as soon as the eyes of the blind man were opened, he seized the clothes of his
benefactor, which were lying on the bank, and protested that they were his own.
Moses, therefore, now prayed that the thief might be struck blind again; and God,
answering his prayer, said, O Moses, know that I am wiser than thou with respect to
my creatures.&mdash;This tradition was related to me in Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V78" id="V78">78.</a></span> It is generally thus that an injured Muslim calls others to his aid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V79" id="V79">79.</a></span> Like the natives of Egypt in the period of the Roman domination,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>modern inhabitants, and the Arabs of other countries (though, I believe, in a less
degree), are notorious for their obstinacy in refusing to pay their taxes until they have
been severely beaten. They well know that, the more readily they pay, the more will
be exacted from them; and are often heard to boast of the number of stripes which
they have received before yielding their money. The same obstinacy is generally displayed
by an Arab accused of any offence; and often, even by a witness: in either case
the man fears that, should he tell at once all he can, the judge will try whether the
stick or the kurb&aacute;j<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> will elicit a further confession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V80" id="V80">80.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the general Corruptness of Muslim Judges.</i> Khi&#7693;r Bey (whether he
was a judge I do not know), conversing one day with his friends on the difficulties experienced
in the exercise of judicature, one of the company remarked, "In my opinion,
the greatest difficulty that is met with is, when one of the parties is rich, and the other,
poor."&mdash;"In that case," replied Khi&#7693;r Bey, "I find none; for it is clear that the rich
will gain his cause, and the poor will lose: but the great difficulty is, when the two
parties are equally rich and powerful. If thou, he continued, being a poor man, have
a suit against one who is rich and powerful, beware of applying to the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee; for he
will not fail to condemn thee: my advice is, that thou desist altogether from thy suit,
and rather throw thyself at the feet of thine adversary; for thou wilt obtain more
justice from him than from the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee."<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>&mdash;For a justification of the opinion here expressed,

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V81" id="V81">81.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On good and evil Omens.</i> Of omens I have already treated, in Note 15 to
Chapter i.: but a few words on this subject must be here added.&mdash;It is common to
draw a lucky or unlucky omen from the first object seen on going out in the morning;
and according as that object is pleasant or the contrary, the person says, "my morning
is good," or "&mdash;&mdash;bad." A one-eyed man is regarded as of evil omen; and especially
one who is blind of the <i>left</i> eye. Many a person is related to have suffered for having
an unlucky countenance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V82" id="V82">82.</a></span> The portion of this story comprised in the first paragraph having been
the subject of a specimen of the present publication, translated from the Calcutta
edition of the first two hundred nights, and printed and distributed when I had not in
my possession the copy of the original which I have taken as my general standard, it
is here given nearly in the same words: I have only made a few slight additions and
alterations derived from a comparison of the two editions. Some of the notes inserted
in the specimen I omit in this place, as they relate to matters already explained.&mdash;Hole
remarks (in page 223), that this part of the Barber's story of his Fifth Brother is derived
"from an Indian fable of the remotest antiquity ... found in the Heeto-pades of
Veeshnoo-Sarma," in which a Brahman "inadvertently breaks his pottery ware ... with
a walking-stick ... in the act of suppressing the outrageous jealousy of four beautiful
but turbulent wives."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V83" id="V83">83.</a></span> "El-Feshsh&aacute;r" signifies "the Foolish Talker," or "Vain Boaster." I have
substituted this name for "El-'Ashsh&aacute;r," the reading in my original. In the Arabic characters,
the latter differs from the former in little more than the want of a point, and
has no appropriate meaning. It appears that, in most copies of the original, the
barber's Fifth Brother is surnamed "En-Neshsh&aacute;r," or "the Sawyer," perhaps in allusion
to his incessant loquacity: but this, also, in the Arabic characters, very nearly
resembles "El-Feshsh&aacute;r," which I doubt not to be the right name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V84" id="V84">84.</a></span> There is nothing very extravagant in this hope of the barber's brother;
for in the East, persons frequently rise from very low to very high stations; and it is
remarkable that, notwithstanding their usual pride, they generally retain the appellation
of the trade or craft which they or their fathers pursued, however ignoble, before

name the appellation of "the druggist or perfumer," or "the grocer," &amp;c.; and he is
not a whit the less respected on this account.</p>

many of the shopkeepers and passengers as they pass through the streets of Eastern
cities, and often greeted with a short ejaculatory prayer for the continuance of their
life and happiness. When a very great man rides through the streets, most of the
shopkeepers rise to him, and pay their respect to him by inclining the head, and
touching the lips and forehead or turban with the fingers of the right hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V93" id="V93">93.</a></span> An occurrence of a similar nature, which happened a few years ago in
Cairo, was related to me by one of my friends there.&mdash;An old woman frequented the
tomb of a saint in that city, near the eastern gate called the B&aacute;b el-Ma&#7717;roo&#7731;, to which
many women afflicted with disease or barrenness often resorted to offer up prayers,
believing their petitions would be effectual through the saint's intercession; and she
was in the habit of enticing ladies from this tomb to the house of her husband, which
was near by, under pretence of his serving them with medicines or with charms. The
unsuspecting victim, being desired to go thither alone, was conducted by the old woman
to an upper room, at the end of which the man was seated; and in walking over the
matted floor to approach him, suddenly fell through a trap-door into a place so deep
that the fall rendered her senseless. In this state, she was put to death; and as ladies
in Cairo always wear valuable ornaments and costly clothes, the murderers were sure of
obtaining considerable spoil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V94" id="V94">94.</a></span> This money, we are to understand, was prepared for the purpose of
giving those presents which are customary from a guest at a marriage-festivity; but
the mention of a smaller sum would have been more proper. It is given to the singing-women
and tire-women who, in great houses, parade the bride through the different
apartments, and display her in different rich suits of attire before the bridegroom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="V95" id="V95">95.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Handkerchief, and Signet, of Indemnity.</i> Sometimes, the handkerchief,
and sometimes, the signet, or seal-ring, is given as a pledge of indemnity.&mdash;It was
a frequent custom of many a chief of the Memlooks of Egypt (there commonly called
"the Ghuzz"), to bastinade men in the court of his mansion (when he desired to make a
show of strict justice), in order that one of the women of the family, hearing the cries,
might drop a handkerchief from a window, and so the punishment might soon cease, in
respect for the &#7717;areem, whose protection is often appealed to by offenders.</p>

treacle thickened over the fire.&mdash;The proper singular of &#7731;a&#7789;&aacute;&iuml;f, namely, "&#7731;a&#7789;eefeh," is
seldom used; one of these cakes being generally called "fard &#7731;a&#7789;&aacute;&iuml;f." Sometimes, it

of the sword at Mekkeh proves Mr. Lane to be in
error; whereas the custom is observed at Mekkeh
because it was taken in war; but not at El-Medeeneh
because this city was not so taken.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h6>COMMENCING WITH PART OF THE THIRTY-SECOND NIGHT, AND ENDING WITH
PART OF THIS THIRTY-SIXTH.</h6>

<h5>THE STORY OF NOOR-ED-DEEN AND ENEES-EL-JELEES.<a href="#VI1" class="fnanchor">1</a></h5>

<p>There was, in El-Ba&#7779;rah, a certain King who loved the poor and
indigent, and regarded his subjects with benevolence; he bestowed of
his wealth upon him who believed in Mo&#7717;ammad (God bless and
save him!) and was such as one of the poets who have written of him
hath thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He used his lances as pens; and the hearts of his enemies, as paper; their blood being his ink:</span>
<span class="i0">And hence, I imagine, our forefathers applied to the lance the term Kha&#7789;&#7789;eeyeh,<a href="#VI2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
The name of this King was Mo&#7717;ammad the son of Suleym&aacute;n Ez-Zeynee;
and he had two Wezeers; one of whom was named El-Mo'een<a href="#VI3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
the son of S&aacute;wee; and the other, El-Fa&#7693;l<a href="#VI4" class="fnanchor">4</a> the son of
Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n. El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n was the most generous of the
people of his age, upright in conduct, so that all hearts agreed in
loving him, and the wise complied with his counsel, and all the
people supplicated for him length of life; for he was a person of
auspicious aspect,<a href="#VI5" class="fnanchor">5</a> a preventer of evil and mischief: but the Wezeer
El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee hated others, and loved not good; he
was a man of inauspicious aspect; and in the same degree that the
people loved Fa&#7693;l-ed-Deen the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n, so did they abhor
El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee, in accordance with the decree of the
Almighty.</p>

<p>Now the King Mo&#7717;ammad the son of Suleym&aacute;n Ez-Zeynee was
sitting one day upon his throne, surrounded by the officers of his
court, and he called to his Wezeer El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n, and
said to him, I desire a female slave unsurpassed in beauty by any in
her age, of perfect loveliness, and exquisite symmetry, and endowed
with all praiseworthy qualities.&mdash;Such as this, replied his courtiers,
is not to be found for less than ten thousand pieces of gold. And
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n thereupon called out to the treasurer, saying, Carry ten
thousand pieces of gold to the house of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n.
So the treasurer did as he commanded, and the Wezeer departed,
after the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n had ordered him to repair every day to the market,
and to commission the brokers to procure what he had described, and
had commanded also that no female slave of a greater price than one
thousand pieces of gold should be sold without having been shewn to
the Wezeer.</p>

<p>The brokers, therefore, sold no female slave without shewing
her to him, and he complied with the King's command, and thus he
continued to do for a considerable time, no slave pleasing him: but
on a certain day, one of the brokers came to the mansion of the
Wezeer El-Fa&#7693;l, and found that he had mounted to repair to the
palace of the King; and he laid hold upon his stirrup, and repeated
these two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O thou who hast reanimated what was rotten in the state! Thou art the Wezeer ever aided by Heaven.</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast revived the noble qualities that were extinct among men. May thy conduct never cease to be approved by God!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then said, O my master, the female slave for the procuring of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
whom the noble mandate was issued hath arrived. The Wezeer
replied, Bring her hither to me. So the man returned, and, after a
short absence, came again, accompanied by a damsel of elegant
stature, high-bosomed, with black eyelashes, and smooth cheek, and
slender waist, and large hips, clad in the handsomest apparel; the
moisture of her lips was sweeter than sirup; her figure put to shame
the branches of the Oriental willow; and her speech was more soft
than the zephyr passing over the flowers of the garden; as one of her
describers hath thus expressed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her skin is like silk, and her speech is soft, neither redundant nor deficient:</span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes, God said to them, Be,&mdash;and they were, affecting men's hearts with the potency of wine.</span>
<span class="i0">May my love for her grow more warm each night, and cease not until the day of judgment!</span>
<span class="i0">The locks on her brow are dark as night, while her forehead shines like the gleam of morning.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Wezeer beheld her, she pleased him extremely, and he
looked towards the broker, and said to him, What is the price of this
damsel? The broker answered, The price bidden for her hath
amounted to ten thousand pieces of gold, and her owner hath sworn
that this sum doth not equal the cost of the chickens which she hath
eaten, nor the cost of the dresses which she hath bestowed upon her
teachers; for she hath learnt writing and grammar and lexicology,
and the interpretation of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and the fundamentals of law
and religion, and medicine, and the computation of the calendar, and
the art of playing upon musical instruments. The Wezeer then said,
Bring to me her master:&mdash;and the broker immediately brought him;
and lo, he was a foreigner, who had lived so long that time had
reduced him to bones and skin, as the poet hath said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How hath time made me to tremble! For time is powerful and severe.</span>
<span class="i0">I used to walk without being weary; but now I am weary and do not walk.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the Wezeer said to him, Art thou content to receive for
this damsel ten thousand pieces of gold from the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Mo&#7717;ammad
the son of Suleym&aacute;n Ez-Zeynee? The foreigner answered, As she
is for the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, it is incumbent on me to give her as a present
to him, without price.<a href="#VI6" class="fnanchor">6</a> So the Wezeer, upon this, ordered that the
money should be brought, and then weighed the pieces of gold for
the foreigner; after which, the slave-broker addressed the Wezeer,
and said, With the permission of our lord the Wezeer, I will speak.&mdash;Impart
what thou hast to say, replied the Wezeer.&mdash;It is my
opinion, then, said the broker, that thou shouldst not take up this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
damsel to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n to-day; for she hath just arrived from her
journey, and the change of air hath affected her, and the journey
hath fatigued her; but rather let her remain with thee in thy
palace ten days, that she may take rest, and her beauty will improve:
then cause her to be taken into the bath, and attire her in clothes of
the handsomest description, and go up with her to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n: so
shalt thou experience more abundant good fortune. And the Wezeer
considered the advice of the slave-broker, and approved it. He
therefore took her into his palace, and gave her a private apartment
to herself, allotting her every day what she required of food and
drink and other supplies, and she continued a while in this state of
enjoyment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px; position: relative;"><a name="f154" id="f154"></a><img src="images/fig154.png" width="420" height="492" alt="Noor-ed-Deen embracing the Slave" title="Noor-ed-Deen embracing the Slave" /></div>

<p>Now the Wezeer El-Fa&#7693;l had a son like the shining full moon,
with brilliant countenance, and red cheek, marked with a mole like a
globule of ambergris, and with grey down. The youth knew not of
this damsel, and his father had charged her, saying, Know that I have
purchased thee for the King Mo&#7717;ammad the son of Suleym&aacute;n
Ez-Zeynee, and that I have a son who hath not left a girl in the
quarter without making love to her: therefore keep thyself concealed
from him, and beware of shewing him thy face, or suffering him to
hear thy voice. The damsel replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and he left
her and departed. And it happened, as fate had ordained, that she
went one day into the bath which was in the house, and, after
certain of the female slaves had bathed her, she attired herself in
rich apparel, and her beauty and loveliness increased in consequence.
She then went in to the Wezeer's wife, and kissed her hand, and she
said to her, May it be favourable,<a href="#VI7" class="fnanchor">7</a> O Enees-el-Jelees! How didst
thou find this bath?&mdash;O my mistress, she answered, I wanted nothing
but thy presence there. And upon this, the mistress of the house
said to the female slaves, Arise, and let us go into the bath. And
they complied with her command, and went, accompanied by their
mistress, who first charged two young slave-girls to keep the door of
the private apartment in which was Enees-el-Jelees, saying to them,
Suffer no one to go in to the damsel:&mdash;and they replied, We hear and
obey. But while Enees-el-Jelees was sitting in her chamber, lo, the
Wezeer's son, whose name was 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, came in, and
asked after his mother and the family. The two girls answered, They
are gone into the bath. Now the damsel Enees-el-Jelees heard the
speech of 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen as she sat in her chamber, and she said
within herself, I wonder what this youth is like, of whom the Wezeer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
hath told me that he hath not left a girl in the quarter without
making love to her: by Allah, I have a desire to see him. She then
rose upon her feet, fresh as she was from the bath, and, approaching
the door of the chamber, looked at 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, and beheld
him to be a youth like the full moon. The sight of him occasioned
her a thousand sighs; and a look from the youth, at her, affected him
also in the same manner. Each was caught in the snare of the other's
love, and the youth approached the two slave-girls, and cried out at
them; whereupon they fled from before him, and stopped at a distance,
looking to see what he would do. He then advanced to the door of
the chamber, and, opening it, went in, and said to the damsel, Art
thou she whom my father hath purchased for me? She answered,
Yes. And upon this, the youth, who was in a state of intoxication,
went up to her, and embraced her, while she, in like manner, threw
her arms around his neck, and kissed him. But the two slave-girls,
having seen their young master enter the chamber of the damsel
Enees-el-Jelees, cried out. The youth, therefore, soon ran forth, and
fled for safety, fearing the consequence of his intrusion; and when the
mistress of the house heard the cry of the two slave-girls, she came out
dripping from the bath, saying, What is the cause of this cry in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
house? And when she drew near to the two slave-girls whom she had
placed at the door of the private chamber, she said to them, Wo to
you! What is the matter?&mdash;They answered, as soon as they beheld
her, Our master 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen came to us and beat us, and we
fled from him, and he went into the chamber of Enees-el-Jelees, and
when we cried out to thee he fled. The mistress of the house then
went to Enees-el-Jelees, and said to her, What is the news?&mdash;O my
mistress, she answered, as I was sitting here, a youth of handsome
person came in to me, and said to me, Art thou she whom my father
hath purchased for me?&mdash;And I answered, Yes.&mdash;By Allah, O my
mistress, I believed that what he said was true; and he came up to
me and embraced me, and kissed me three times, and he left me overcome
by his love.</p>

<p>Upon this, the mistress of the house wept, and slapped her face,
and her female slaves did the like, fearing for 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen,
lest his father should slay him; and while they were in this state, lo,
the Wezeer came in, and inquired what had happened. His wife said
to him, Swear that thou wilt listen to that which I shall say. He
replied, Well. So she told him what his son had done; and he
mourned, and rent his clothes, and slapped his face, and plucked his
beard. His wife then said to him, Kill not thyself. I will give thee,
of my own property, ten thousand pieces of gold, her price.&mdash;But
upon this, he raised his head towards her, and said to her, Wo to thee!
I want not her price; but I fear the loss of my life and my property.&mdash;Wherefore,
O my master? she asked.&mdash;Knowest thou not, said he,
that we have this enemy El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee? When he
heareth of this event, he will repair to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and say to him,
Thy Wezeer whom thou imaginest to love thee hath received from thee
ten thousand pieces of gold, and purchased therewith a female slave
such as no one hath seen equalled, and when she pleased him, he said
to his son, Take her; for thou art more worthy of her than the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n:&mdash;and
he took her; and the damsel is now with him.&mdash;Then the King
will say, Thou liest. And he will say to the King, With thy permission,
I will break in upon him suddenly, and bring her to thee. And
he will give him permission to do so: he will therefore make a sudden
attack upon the house, and take the damsel, and conduct her into the
presence of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and he will question her, and she will not be
able to deny: he will then say, O my lord, I give thee good counsel,
but I am not in favour with thee:&mdash;and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n will make an
example of me, and all the people will make me a gazing-stock, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
my life will be lost.&mdash;His wife, however, replied, Acquaint no one; for
this thing hath happened privily: commit, therefore, thine affair unto
God, in this extremity. And upon this, the heart of the Wezeer was
quieted, and his mind was relieved.</p>

<p>Such was the case of the Wezeer.&mdash;Now as to Noor-ed-Deen, he
feared the result of his conduct, and so passed each day in the gardens,
not returning to his mother until towards the close of the night: he
then slept in her apartment, and rose before morning without being
seen by any one else. Thus he continued to do so for the space of a
month, not seeing the face of his father; and at length his mother
said to his father, O my master, wilt thou lose the damsel and lose the
child? For if it long continue thus with the youth, he will flee his
country.&mdash;And what is to be done? said he. She answered, Sit up
this night, and when he cometh, lay hold upon him, and be reconciled
to him, and give him the damsel; for she loveth him, and he loveth
her; and I will give thee her price. So the Wezeer sat up the whole
night, and when his son came, he laid hold upon him, and would have
cut his throat;<a href="#VI8" class="fnanchor">8</a> but his mother came to his succour, and said to her
husband, What dost thou desire to do unto him? He answered her,
I desire to slay him. The youth then said to his father, Am I of so
small account in thy estimation? And upon this, the eyes of his
father filled with tears, and he said to him, O my son, is the loss of
my property and my life of small account with thee?&mdash;Listen, O my
father, rejoined the youth:&mdash;and he implored his forgiveness. So the
Wezeer rose from the breast of his son, and was moved with compassion
for him; and the youth rose, and kissed his father's hand; and
the Wezeer said, O my son, if I knew that thou wouldst act equitably
to Enees-el-Jelees, I would give her to thee.&mdash;O my father, replied the
youth, wherefore should I not act equitably towards her? And his
father said, I charge thee, O my son, that thou take not a wife to share
her place, and that thou do her no injury, nor sell her. He replied,
O my father, I swear to thee that I will neither take a wife to share
her place, nor sell her:&mdash;and he promised him by oaths to act as he
had said, and took up his abode with the damsel, and remained with
her a year; and God (whose name be exalted!) caused the King to
forget the affair of the female slave; but the matter became known to
El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee; yet he could not speak of it, on account
of the high estimation in which the other Wezeer was held by the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n.</p>

<p>After this year had expired, the Wezeer Fa&#7693;l-ed-Deen the son of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>

<span class="figright3" style="width: 225px; position: relative;"><a name="f155a" id="f155a"></a><img src="images/fig155a.png" width="225" height="64" alt="The Funeral of the Wezeer El-Fadl" title="The Funeral of the Wezeer El-Fa&#7693;l" /></span>

Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n entered the oath, and came out
in a state of excessive perspiration, in consequence
of which the external air smote
him, so that he became confined to his
bed, and long remained sleepless; and his
malady continued unremittingly; so he
called, thereupon, his son 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen,
and when he came before him, said to
him, O my son, verily the means of life are
apportioned, and its period is decreed, and
every soul must drink the cup of death. I
have nothing with which to charge thee but
the fear of God, and forethought with regard
to the results of thine actions, and that thou
conduct thyself kindly to the damsel Enees-el-Jelees.&mdash;O
my father, said the youth, who
is like unto thee? Thou hast been celebrated
for virtuous actions, and the praying of the
preachers for thee on the pulpits.&mdash;O my
son, rejoined the Wezeer, I hope for the
approbation of God, whose name be exalted!
And then he pronounced the two professions
of the faith,<a href="#VI9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and uttered a sigh, and was
recorded among the company of the blest.
And upon this, the palace was filled with
shrieking, and the news reached the ears of
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and the people of the city heard
of the death of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n,
and even the boys in the schools wept for
him.<a href="#VI10" class="fnanchor">10</a> His son 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen arose,
and prepared his funeral, and the Emeers
and Wezeers and other officers of the state
attended it, and among them was the Wezeer
El-Mo'een the Son of S&aacute;wee; and as the
procession passed out from the mansion,
one of the mourners recited these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I said to the man who was appointed to wash him,&mdash;Would that he had yielded obedience to my counsel,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Put away from him the water, and wash him with the tears of honour, shed in lamentation for him:</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
<span class="i0">And remove these fragrant substances collected for his corpse, and perfume him rather with the odours of his praise:</span>
<span class="i0">And order the noble angels to carry him, in honour. Dost thou not behold them attending him?</span>
<span class="i0">Cause not men's necks to be strained by bearing him: enough are they laden already by his benefits.<a href="#VI11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>'Alee Noor-ed-Deen for a long time remained in a state of violent
grief for the loss of his father; but as he was sitting one day in his
father's house, a person knocked at the door, and he rose up and
opened it, and lo, there was a man who was one of his father's intimate
companions, and he kissed the hand of Noor-ed-Deen, and said to
him, O my master, he who hath left a son like thee hath not died.
This is the destination of the lord of the first and the last among mankind.<a href="#VI12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
O my master, cheer up thy heart, and give over mourning.&mdash;And
upon this, 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen arose, and went to the guest-chamber,
and removed thither all that he required, and his companions
came together to him, and he took again his slave. Ten of the sons
of the merchants became his associates, and he gave entertainment
after entertainment, and began to be lavish with presents. His
steward, therefore, came in to him, and said to him, O my master
Noor-ed-Deen, hast thou not heard the saying, He who expendeth and
doth not calculate is reduced to poverty? This profuse expenditure,
and these magnificent presents, will annihilate the property.&mdash;But
when 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen heard these words of his steward, he looked
at him, and replied, Of all that thou hast said to me, I will not attend
to one word. How excellent is the saying of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If I be possessed of wealth and be not liberal, may my hand never be extended, nor my foot raised!</span>
<span class="i0">Shew me the avaricious who hath attained glory by his avarice, and the munificent who hath died through his munificence.<a href="#VI13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Know, O Steward, he continued, that if there remain in thy hands
what will suffice for my dinner, thou shalt not burden me with anxiety
respecting my supper.&mdash;So the steward left him, and went his way;
and 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen resumed his habits of extravagant generosity:
whenever any one of his companions said, Verily this thing is beautiful!&mdash;he
would reply, It is a present to thee:&mdash;and if any said, O my
master, verily such a house is delightful!&mdash;he would reply, It is a
present to thee.</p>

<p>He ceased not to give entertainments to his companions from the
commencement of day, one after another, until he had passed in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
manner a whole year; after which, as he was sitting with them, he
heard the slave-girl recite these two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou thoughtest well of the days when they went well with thee, and fearedst not the evil that destiny was bringing.</span>
<span class="i0">Thy nights were peaceful, and thou wast deceived by them: in the midst of their brightness there cometh gloom.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And immediately after, a person knocked at the door: so Noor-ed-Deen
rose, and one of his companions followed him without his
knowledge; and when he opened the door, he beheld his steward, and
said to him, What is the news?&mdash;O my master, answered the steward,
that which I feared on thy account hath happened to thee.&mdash;How is
that? asked Noor-ed-Deen. The steward answered, Know that there
remaineth not of thy property in my hands, anything equivalent to a
piece of silver, or less than a piece of silver; and these are the accounts
of thy expenses, and of thy original property. When 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen
heard these words, he hung down his head towards the ground,
and exclaimed, There is no strength nor power but in God! And the
man who had followed him secretly to pry into his case, as soon as he
heard what the steward told him, returned to his companions, and
said to them, See what ye will do; for 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen hath
become a bankrupt. So when Noor-ed-Deen returned to them, grief
appeared to them in his countenance, and immediately one of them
rose, and, looking towards him, said to him, O my master, I desire
that thou wouldst permit me to depart.&mdash;Why thus depart to-day?
said Noor-ed-Deen. His guest answered, My wife is to give birth to
a child this night, and it is impossible for me to be absent from her: I
desire, therefore, to go and see her. And he gave him leave. Then
another rose, and said to him, O my master Noor-ed-Deen, I desire
to-day to visit my brother; for he celebrateth the circumcision of his
son. Thus each of them asked leave of him deceitfully, and went his
way, until all had departed.</p>

<p>So 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen remained alone; and he called his slave-girl,
and said to her, O Enees-el-Jelees, seest thou not what hath
befallen me? And he related to her what the steward had told him.
She replied, O my master, for some nights past, I have been anxious
to speak to thee of this affair; but I heard thee reciting these two
verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When fortune is liberal to thee, be thou liberal to all others before she escape from thee:</span>
<span class="i0">For liberality will not annihilate thy wealth when she is favourable; nor avarice preserve it when she deserteth thee.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when I heard thee repeat these words, I was silent, and would
not make any remark to thee.&mdash;O Enees-el-Jelees, he rejoined, thou
knowest that I have not expended my wealth but on my companions;
and I do not think that they will abandon me without relief.&mdash;By Allah,
said she, they will be of no use to thee. But he said, I will immediately
arise and go to them, and knock at their doors: perhaps I
shall obtain from them something which I will employ as a capital
wherewith to trade, and I will cease from diversion and sport. So he
arose instantly, and proceeded without stopping until he arrived at
the by-street in which his ten companions resided; for they all lived in
that same street: and he advanced to the first door, and knocked; and
there came forth to him a slave-girl, who said to him, Who art thou?
He answered, Say to thy master,&mdash;'Alee Noor-ed-Deen is standing at
the door, and saith to thee, Thy slave kisseth thy hands, looking for a
favour from thee.&mdash;And the girl entered, and acquainted her master;
but he called out to her, saying, Return, and tell him, He is not here.&mdash;The
girl, therefore, returned to Noor-ed-Deen, and said to him, My
master, Sir, is not here. And he went on, saying within myself, If
this is a knave, and hath denied himself, another is not. He then
advanced to the next door, and said as he had before; and the second
also denied himself; and Noor-ed-Deen exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They are gone, who, if thou stoodest at their door, would bestow upon thee the bounty thou desirest.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>By Allah, he added, I must try all of them: perchance one of them
may stand me in the place of all the others. And he went round to
all the ten; but found not that one of them would open the door, or
shew himself, or even order him a cake of bread; and he recited the
following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A man in prosperity resembleth a tree, around which people flock as long as it hath fruit;</span>
<span class="i0">But as soon as it hath dropped all that it bore, they disperse from beneath it, and seek another.</span>
<span class="i0">Perdition to all the people of this age! for I find not one man of integrity among ten.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then returned to his slave: his anxiety had increased, and she
said to him, O my master, said I not unto thee that they would not
profit thee?&mdash;By Allah, he replied, not one of them shewed me his
face.&mdash;O my master, rejoined she, sell of the moveables of the house a
little at a time, and expend the produce. And he did so until he had
sold all that was in the house, and there remained nothing in his pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>session;
and upon this he looked towards Enees-el-Jelees, and said to
her, What shall we do now?&mdash;It is my advice, O my master, she
answered, that thou arise immediately, and take me to the market,
and sell me; for thou knowest that thy father purchased me for ten
thousand pieces of gold, and perhaps God may open to thee a way to
obtain a part of this price; and if God have decreed our reunion, we
shall meet again. But he replied, O Enees-el-Jelees, it is not easy for me
to endure thy separation for one hour.&mdash;Nor is the like easy to me,
said she: but necessity is imperious. And upon this, he took Enees-el-Jelees,
his tears flowing down his cheeks, and went and delivered
her to the broker, saying to him, Know the value of that which thou
art to cry for sale.&mdash;O my master Noor-ed-Deen, replied the broker,
noble qualities are held in remembrance. Is she not Enees-el-Jelees,
whom thy father purchased of me for ten thousand pieces of gold?&mdash;He
answered, Yes. And the broker thereupon went to the merchants;
but he found that they had not all yet assembled; so he waited until
the rest had come, and the market was filled with all varieties of
female slaves, Turkish and Greek and Circassian and Georgian and
Abyssinian; and when he beheld its crowded state, he arose and
exclaimed, O merchants! O possessors of wealth! everything that is
round is not a nut; nor is everything long, a banana; nor is everything
that is red, meat; nor is everything white, fat; nor is everything that
is ruddy, wine; nor is everything tawny, a date! O merchants!
this precious pearl, whose value no money can equal, with what sum
will ye open the bidding for her?&mdash;And one of the merchants answered,
With four thousand and five hundred pieces of gold.<a href="#VI14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 515px; position: relative;"><a name="f156" id="f156"></a><img src="images/fig156.png" width="515" height="567" alt="The Wezeer El-Mo'een in the Slave-Market" title="The Wezeer El-Mo'een in the Slave-Market" /></div>

<p>But, lo, the Wezeer El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee was in the market,
and, seeing 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen standing there, he said within himself,
What doth he want here, having nothing left wherewith to purchase
female slaves? Then casting his eyes around, and hearing the
broker as he stood crying in the market with the merchants around
him, he said within himself, I do not imagine anything else than that
he hath become a bankrupt, and come forth with the slave-girl to sell
her; and if this be the case, how pleasant to my heart! He then
called the crier, who approached him, and kissed the ground before
him;<a href="#VI15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and the Wezeer said to him, I desire this female slave whom
thou art crying for sale. The broker, therefore, being unable to
oppose his wish, brought the slave and placed her before him; and
when he beheld her, and considered her charms, her elegant figure and
her soft speech, he was delighted with her, and said to the broker, To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
what has the bidding for her amounted? The broker answered, Four
thousand and five hundred pieces of gold. And as soon as the merchants
heard this, not one of them could bid another piece of silver or
of gold; but all of them drew back, knowing the tyrannical conduct
of that Wezeer. El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee then looked towards
the broker, and said to him, Why standest thou still? Take away the
slave-girl for me at the price of four thousand and five hundred pieces
of gold, and thou wilt have five hundred for thyself.&mdash;So the broker
went to 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, and said to him, O my master, the slave-girl
is lost to thee without price.&mdash;How so? said Noor-ed-Deen.
The broker answered, We opened the bidding for her at four thousand
and five hundred pieces of gold; but this tyrant El-Mo'een the son of
S&aacute;wee came into the market, and when he beheld the damsel she
pleased him, and he said to me, Ask her owner if he will agree for
four thousand pieces of gold, and five hundred for thee:&mdash;and I doubt
not but he knoweth that the slave belongeth to thee; and if he give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
thee her price immediately, it will be through the goodness of God;
but I know, from his injustice, that he will write thee an order upon
some of his agents for the money, and then send to them and desire
them to give thee nothing; and every time that thou shalt go to demand
it of them, they will say to thee, To-morrow we will pay thee:&mdash;and
they will not cease to promise thee, and to defer from day to day,
notwithstanding thy pride; and when they are overcome by thy
importunity they will say, Give us the written order:&mdash;and as soon as
they have received the paper from thee they will tear it in pieces: so
thou wilt lose the price of the slave.</p>

<p>When Noor-ed-Deen, therefore, heard these words of the broker,
he said to him, What is to be done? The broker answered, I will
give thee a piece of advice, and if thou receive it from me, thou wilt
have better fortune.&mdash;What is it? asked Noor-ed-Deen.&mdash;That thou
come to me immediately, answered the broker, while I am standing in
the midst of the market, and take the slave-girl from me, and give her
a blow with thy hand, and say to her, Wo to thee! I have expiated
my oath that I swore, and brought thee to the market, because I swore
to thee that thou shouldst be exposed in the market, and that the
broker should cry thee for sale.&mdash;If thou do this, perhaps the trick
will deceive him and the people, and they will believe that thou tookest
her not to the market but to expiate the oath.&mdash;This, replied Noor-ed-Deen,
is the right counsel. So the broker returned into the midst of
the market, and, taking hold of the hand of the slave-girl, made a
sign to the Wezeer El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee, saying, O my lord,
this is her owner who hath just come. Then 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen
advanced to the broker, and tore the damsel from him, and struck her
with his hand, saying to her, Wo to thee! I have brought thee to
the market for the sake of expiating my oath. Go home, and disobey
me not again. I want not thy price, that I should sell thee; and if I
sold the furniture of the house and everything else of the kind over
and over again, their produce would not amount to thy price.&mdash;But
when El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee beheld Noor-ed-Deen, he said to
him, Wo to thee! Hast thou anything left to be sold or bought?&mdash;And
he would have laid violent hands upon him. The merchants
then looked towards Noor-ed-Deen (and they all loved him), and he
said to them, Here am I before you, and ye have all known his tyranny.&mdash;By
Allah, exclaimed the Wezeer, were it not for you, I had killed
him! Then all of them made signs, one to another, with the eye, and
said, Not one of us will interfere between thee and him. And upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
this, 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen went up to the Wezeer, the son of S&aacute;wee
(and Noor-ed-Deen was a man of courage), and he dragged the
Wezeer from his saddle, and threw him upon the ground. There was
at that spot a kneading-place for mud,<a href="#VI16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and the Wezeer fell into the
midst of it, and Noor-ed-Deen beat him with his fist, and a blow fell
upon his teeth, by which his beard became dyed with his blood. Now
there were with the Wezeer ten memlooks, and when they saw Noor-ed-Deen
treat their master in this manner, they put their hands upon
the hilts of their swords, and would have fallen upon him and cut him
in pieces; but the people said to them, This is a Wezeer, and this is
the son of a Wezeer, and perhaps they may make peace with each
other, and ye will incur the anger of both of them; or perhaps a blow
may fall upon your master, and ye will all of you die the most ignominious
of deaths: it is advisable, therefore, that ye interfere not
between them.&mdash;And when 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen had ceased from beating
the Wezeer, he took his slave-girl, and returned to his house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px; position: relative;"><a name="f157" id="f157"></a><img src="images/fig157.png" width="377" height="426" alt="El-Mo'een in his Abasement" title="El-Mo'een in his Abasement" /></div>

<p>The Wezeer, the son of S&aacute;wee, then immediately arose, and his
dress, which before was white, was now dyed with three colours, the
colour of mud, and the colour of blood, and the colour of ashes;<a href="#VI17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and
when he beheld himself in this condition, he took a round mat,<a href="#VI18" class="fnanchor">18</a> and
hung it to his neck, and took in his hand two bundles of coarse grass,<a href="#VI19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
and went and stood beneath the palace of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and cried out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
O King of the age! I am oppressed!&mdash;So they brought him before
the King, who looked at him attentively, and saw that he was his
Wezeer, El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee. He said, therefore, Who hath
done thus unto thee?&mdash;and the Wezeer cried and moaned, and
repeated these two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shall fortune oppress me while thou existest; and the dogs devour me when thou art a lion?</span>
<span class="i0">Shall all else who are dry drink freely from thy tanks, and I thirst in thine asylum when thou art as rain?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;O my lord, he continued, thus is every one who loveth thee and
serveth thee: these afflictions always befall him.&mdash;And who, said the
King again, hath done thus unto thee?&mdash;Know, answered the Wezeer,
that I went forth to-day to the market of the female slaves with the
idea of buying a cook-maid, and saw in the market a slave-girl the
like of whom I had never in my life beheld, and the broker said that
she belonged to 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen. Now our lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n had
given his father ten thousand pieces of gold to buy for him with it a
beautiful female slave, and he bought that girl, and she pleased him;
so he gave her to his son; and when his father died, the son pursued
the path of prodigality, until he sold all his houses and gardens and
utensils; and when he had become a bankrupt, nothing else remaining
in his possession, he took the slave-girl to the market to sell her, and
delivered her to the broker: so he cried her for sale, and the merchants
continued bidding for her until her price amounted to four thousand
pieces of gold; whereupon I said to myself, I will buy this for our
lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n; for her original price was from him. I therefore
said, O my son, receive her price, four thousand pieces of gold. But
when he heard my words, he looked at me and replied, O ill-omened
old man! I will sell her to the Jews and the Christians rather than to
thee.&mdash;I then said to him, I would not buy her for myself, but for our
lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, who is our benefactor. As soon, however, as he had
heard these words from me, he was filled with rage, and dragged me
and threw me down from the horse, notwithstanding my advanced
age, and beat me, and ceased not to do so until he left me in the state
in which thou seest me. Nothing exposed me to all this ill treatment
but my coming to purchase this slave-girl for your majesty.&mdash;The
Wezeer then threw himself upon the ground, and lay weeping and
trembling.</p>

<p>Now when the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n beheld his condition, and had heard his
speech, the vein of anger swelled between his eyes, and he looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
towards the members of his court who were attending him; whereupon
forty swordsmen stood before him, and he said to them, Descend
immediately to the house of 'Alee the son of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of
Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n, and plunder it and demolish it, and bring hither him and
the slave-girl with their hands bound behind them: drag them along
upon their faces, and so bring them before me. They replied, We
hear and obey:&mdash;and went forth to repair to the house of 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen.
But there was in the court of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n a chamberlain
named 'Alam-ed-Deen Senjer, who had been one of the memlooks of
El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n, the father of 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen; and
when he heard the order of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and saw the enemies prepared
to slay his master's son, it was insupportable to him; so he mounted
his horse, and proceeded to the house of 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, and
knocked at the door. Noor-ed-Deen came forth to him, and, when
he saw him, knew him, and would have saluted him; but he said, O
my master, this is not a time for salutation, nor for talking. Noor-ed-Deen
said, O 'Alam-ed-Deen, what is the news? He replied, Save
thyself by flight, thou and the slave-girl; for El-Mo'een the son of
S&aacute;wee hath set up a snare for you, and if ye fall into his hands he will
slay you: the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n hath sent to you forty swordsmen, and it is my
advice that ye fly before the evil fall upon you. Then Senjer stretched
forth his hand to Noor-ed-Deen with some pieces of gold, and he
counted them, and found them to be forty pieces; and he said, O my
master, receive these, and if I had with me more, I would give it thee:
but this is not a time for expostulating. And upon this, Noor-ed-Deen
went in to the damsel, and acquainted her with the occurrence,
and she was confounded.</p>

<p>The two then went forth immediately from the city, and God let
down the veil of his protection upon them, and they proceeded to the
bank of the river, where they found a vessel ready to sail: the master
was standing in the midst of it, and saying, He who hath anything to
do, whether leave-taking or procuring provisions, or who hath forgotten
aught, let him do what he desireth and return; for we are going.
And they all replied, We have nothing remaining to do, O master.
So, upon this, the master said to his crew, Quick! Loose the rope's
end, and pull up the stake.<a href="#VI20" class="fnanchor">20</a>&mdash;And 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen exclaimed,
Whither, O master? He answered, To the Abode of Peace, Baghd&aacute;d.
And Noor-ed-Deen embarked, and the damsel with him, and they set
the vessel afloat, and spread the sails, and it shot along like a bird
with its pair of wings, carrying them forward with a favourable wind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the forty men whom the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n had sent came to the
house of 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, and broke open the doors and entered,
and searched all the chambers, but without success; so they demolished
the house, and returned, and acquainted the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, who said, Search
for them in every place where they may be:&mdash;and they replied, We
hear and obey. The Wezeer El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee then
descended to his house, after the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n had invested him with a robe
of honour, and had said to him, None shall take vengeance for thee
but myself. And he greeted the King with a prayer for long life, and
his heart was set at ease: and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n gave orders to proclaim
throughout the city, O all ye people! our lord the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n hath commanded
that whoever shall meet with 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, and bring
him to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, shall be invested with a robe of honour, and he
will give him a thousand pieces of gold; and he who shall conceal him,
or know where he is, and not give information thereof, will merit the
exemplary punishment that shall befall him! So all the people began
to search for him; but could not trace him.&mdash;Such was the case with
these people.</p>

<p>Now as to 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen and his slave, they arrived in safety
at Baghd&aacute;d, and the master of the vessel said to them, This is Baghd&aacute;d,
and it is a city of security: winter with its cold hath departed from it,
and the spring-quarter hath come with its roses, and its trees are in
blossom, and its waters are flowing. And upon this, 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen
landed with his slave-girl, and gave the master five pieces of
gold. They then walked a little way, and destiny cast them among
the gardens, and they came to a place which they found swept and
sprinkled, with long ma&#7779;&#7789;abahs, and pots suspended filled with water,
and over it was a covering of trellis-work of canes extending along the
whole length of a lane, at the upper end of which was the gate of a
garden; but this was shut. And Noor-ed-Deen said to the damsel,
By Allah, this is a pleasant place!&mdash;and she replied, O my master, let
us sit down a while upon one of these ma&#7779;&#7789;abahs. So they mounted
and seated themselves there, and they washed their faces and hands,
and enjoyed the current of the zephyr, and slept.&mdash;Glory be to Him
who sleepeth not!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px; position: relative;"><a name="f158" id="f158"></a><img src="images/fig158.png" width="520" height="604" alt="The Lane leading to 'The Garden of Delight'" title="The Lane leading to 'The Garden of Delight'" /></div>

<p>This garden was called the Garden of Delight, and in it was a
palace called the Palace of Diversion, and it belonged to the Khaleefeh
H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed, who, when his heart was contracted, used to come
to this garden, and enter the palace above mentioned, and there sit.
The palace had eighty latticed windows, and eighty lamps were sus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>pended
in it, and in the midst of it was a great candlestick of gold;
and when the Khaleefeh entered it, he commanded the female slaves
to open the windows, and ordered Is-&#7717;&aacute;&#7731; the cup-companion to sing
with them: so his heart became dilated, and his anxiety ceased.
There was a superintendent to the garden, an old man, named the
sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem; and it happened that he went forth once to transact
some business, and found there persons diverting themselves with
women of suspicious character, whereupon he was violently enraged,
and having waited until the Khaleefeh came thither some days after,
he acquainted him with this occurrence, and the Khaleefeh said,
Whomsoever thou shalt find at the gate of the garden, do with him
what thou wilt. Now on this day the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem went out to
transact an affair of business, and found the two sleeping at the garden-gate
covered with a single iz&aacute;r; and he said, Do not these two persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
know that the Khaleefeh hath given me permission to kill every one
whom I find here? But I will only give these two a slight beating, that
no one may again approach the gate of the garden. He then cut a
green palm-stick, and went forth to them, and raised his hand until
the whiteness of his arm-pit appeared, and was about to beat them;
but he reflected in his mind, and said, O Ibr&aacute;heem, how shouldst thou
beat them when thou knowest not their case? They may be two
strangers, or of the children of the road,<a href="#VI21" class="fnanchor">21</a> whom destiny hath cast
here. I will therefore uncover their faces, and look at them.&mdash;So he
lifted up the iz&aacute;r from their faces, and said, These are two handsome
persons, and it is not proper that I should beat them. And he
covered their faces again, and, approaching the foot of 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen,
began to rub it gently;<a href="#VI22" class="fnanchor">22</a> whereupon Noor-ed-Deen opened his
eyes, and saw that he was an old man; and he blushed, and drew in
his feet, and, sitting up, took the hand of the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem and
kissed it; and the sheykh said to him, O my son, whence are ye?&mdash;O
my master, he answered, we are strangers.&mdash;And a tear gushed from
his eye. The sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem then said to him, O my son, know
that the Prophet (God bless and save him!) hath enjoined generosity
to the stranger. Wilt thou not arise, O my son, and enter the garden,
and divert thyself in it, that thy heart may be dilated?&mdash;O my master,
said Noor-ed-Deen, to whom doth this garden belong? The sheykh
answered, O my son, this garden I inherited from my family. And
his design in saying this was only that they might feel themselves at
ease, and enter the garden. And when Noor-ed-Deen heard his words,
he thanked him, and arose, together with his slave, and, the sheykh
Ibr&aacute;heem preceding them, they entered the garden.</p>

<p>The gate was arched, and over it were vines with grapes of different
colours; the red, like rubies; and the black, like ebony. They
entered a bower, and found within it fruits growing in clusters and
singly, and the birds were warbling their various notes upon the
branches: the nightingale was pouring forth its melodious sounds;
and the turtle-dove filled the place with its cooing; and the blackbird,
in its singing, resembled a human being; and the ring-dove, a person
exhilarated by wine. The fruits upon the trees, comprising every
description that was good to eat, had ripened; and there were two of
each kind: there were the camphor-apricot, and the almond-apricot,
and the apricot of Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n; the plum of a colour like the complexion
of beauties; the cherry delighting the sense of every man;
the red, the white, and the green fig, of the most beautiful colours;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
and flowers like pearls and coral; the rose, whose redness put to shame
the cheeks of the lovely; the violet, like sulphur in contact with fire;
the myrtle, the gilliflower, the lavender, and the anemone; and their
leaves were bespangled with the tears of the clouds; the chamomile
smiled, displaying its teeth, and the narcissus looked at the rose with
its negroes' eyes; the citrons resembled round cups; the limes were
like bullets of gold; the ground was carpeted with flowers of every
colour, and the place beamed with the charms of spring; the river
murmured by while the birds sang, and the wind whistled among the
trees; the season was temperate, and the zephyr was languishing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 538px; position: relative;"><a name="f159" id="f159"></a><img src="images/fig159.png" width="538" height="535" alt="Bower in 'The Garden of Delight'" title="Bower in 'The Garden of Delight'" /></div>

<p>The sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem conducted them into the elevated saloon,<a href="#VI23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
and they were charmed with its beauty and the extraordinary elegances
which it displayed, and seated themselves in one of the windows; and
Noor-ed-Deen, reflecting upon his past entertainments, exclaimed, By
Allah, this place is most delightful! It hath reminded me of past
events, and quenched in me an anguish like the fire of the gha&#7693;&agrave;.<a href="#VI24" class="fnanchor">24</a>&mdash;The
sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem then brought to them some food, and they ate
to satisfaction, and washed their hands, and Noor-ed-Deen, seating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
himself again in one of the windows, called to his slave, and she came
to him; and they sat gazing at the trees laden with all kinds of fruits;
after which, Noor-ed-Deen looked towards the sheykh, and said to him,
O sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, hast thou not any beverage? For people drink
after eating.&mdash;So the sheykh brought him some sweet and cold water:
but Noor-ed-Deen said, This is not the beverage I desire.&mdash;Dost thou
want wine? asked the sheykh.&mdash;Yes, answered Noor-ed-Deen. The
sheykh exclaimed, I seek refuge with Allah from it! Verily, for thirteen
years I have done nothing of that kind; for the Prophet (God
bless and save him!) cursed its drinker and its presser and its carrier.&mdash;Hear
from me two words, said Noor-ed-Deen. The sheykh replied,
Say what thou wilt. So he said, If thou be neither the presser of the
wine, nor its drinker, nor its carrier, will aught of the curse fall upon
thee? The sheykh answered, No.&mdash;Then take this piece of gold,
rejoined Noor-ed-Deen, and these two pieces of silver, and mount the
ass, and halt at a distance from the place, and whatsoever man thou
findest to buy it, call to him, and say to him, take these two pieces of
silver, and with this piece of gold buy some wine, and place it upon
the ass:&mdash;so, in this case, thou wilt be neither the carrier, nor the
presser, nor the buyer; and nothing will befall thee of that which
befalleth the rest.</p>

<p>The sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, after laughing at his words, replied, By
Allah, I have never seen one more witty than thou, nor heard speech
more sweet. And Noor-ed-Deen said to him, We have become
dependant upon thee, and thou hast nothing to do but to comply with
our wishes: bring us, therefore, all that we require.&mdash;O my son, said
the sheykh, my buttery here is before thee (and it was the store-room
furnished for the Prince of the Faithful): enter it then, and take from
it what thou wilt; for it containeth more than thou desirest. So
Noor-ed-Deen entered the store-room, and beheld in it vessels of gold
and silver and crystal, adorned with a variety of jewels; and he took
out such of them as he desired, and poured the wine into the vessels
of earthenware and bottles of glass; and he and the damsel began to
drink, astonished at the beauty of the things which they beheld. The
sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem then brought to them sweet-scented flowers, and
seated himself at a distance from them; and they continued drinking,
in a state of the utmost delight, until the wine took effect upon them,
and their cheeks reddened, and their eyes wantoned like those of the
gazelle, and their hair hung down:<a href="#VI25" class="fnanchor">25</a> whereupon the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem
said, What aileth me that I am sitting at a distance from them?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Why should I not sit by them? And when shall I be in the company
of such as these two, who are like two moons?&mdash;He then advanced,
and seated himself at the edge of the raised portion of the floor; and
Noor-ed-Deen said to him, O my master, by my life I conjure thee to
approach and join us. So he went to them; and Noor-ed-Deen filled
a cup, and, looking at the sheykh, said to him, Drink, that thou
mayest know how delicious is its flavour. But the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem
exclaimed, I seek refuge with Allah! Verily, for thirteen years I have
done nothing of that kind.&mdash;And Noor-ed-Deen, feigning to pay no
attention to him, drank the cup, and threw himself upon the ground,
pretending that intoxication had overcome him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px; position: relative;"><a name="f160" id="f160"></a><img src="images/fig160.png" width="409" height="184" alt="Enees-el-Jelees offering the Wine" title="Enees-el-Jelees offering the Wine" /></div>

<p>Upon this, Enees-el-Jelees looked towards the sheykh, and said to
him, O sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, see how this man hath treated me.&mdash;O my
mistress, said he, what aileth him? She rejoined, Always doth he
treat me thus: he drinketh a while, and then sleepeth, and I remain
alone, and find no one to keep me company over my cup. If I drink,
who will serve me? And if I sing, who will hear me?&mdash;The sheykh,
moved with tenderness and affection for her by her words, replied, It
is not proper that a cup-companion be thus. The damsel then filled a
cup, and, looking at the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, said to him, I conjure thee,
by my life that thou take it and drink it; reject it not, but accept it,
and refresh my heart. So he stretched forth his hand, and took the
cup, and drank it; and she filled for him a second time, and handed
it to him, saying, O my master, this remaineth for thee. He replied,
By Allah, I cannot drink it: that which I have drunk is enough for
me. But she said, By Allah, it is indispensable:&mdash;and he took the
cup, and drank it. She then gave him the third; and he took it,
and was about to drink it, when, lo, Noor-ed-Deen raised himself, and
said to him, O sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, what is this? Did I not conjure
thee a while ago, and thou refusedst, and saidst, Verily, for thirteen
years I have not done it?&mdash;The sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, touched with
shame, replied, By Allah, I am not in fault; for she pressed me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
And Noor-ed-Deen laughed, and they resumed their carousal, and the
damsel, turning her eyes towards her master, said to him, O my master,
drink thou, and do not urge the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem; that I may divert
thee with the sight of him. So she began to fill and to hand to her
master, and her master filled and gave to her, and thus they continued
to do, time after time; till at length the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem looked
towards them and said, What meaneth this? And what sort of
carousal is this? Wherefore do ye not give me to drink, since I have
become your cup-companion?&mdash;At this they both laughed until they
became almost senseless; and then drank, and gave him to drink;
and they continued thus until the expiration of a third of the night,
when the damsel said, O sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, with thy permission shall
I rise and light one of the candles which are arranged here?&mdash;Rise,
he answered; but light not more than one candle. But she sprang
upon her feet, and, beginning with the first candle, proceeded until
she had lighted eighty. She then sat down again; and presently
Noor-ed-Deen said, O sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, in what favour am I held
with thee? Wilt thou not allow me to light one of these lamps?&mdash;The
sheykh answered, Arise, and light one lamp, and be not thou also
troublesome. So he arose, and, beginning with the first lamp, lighted
all the eighty; and the saloon seemed to dance. And after this, the
sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, overcome by intoxication, said to them, Ye are more
frolicksome than I:&mdash;and he sprang upon his feet, and opened all the
windows, and sat down again with them, and they continued carousing
and reciting verses; and the place rang with their merriment.</p>

<p>Now God, the All-seeing and All-knowing, who hath appointed a
cause to every event, had decreed that the Khaleefeh should be sitting
that night at one of the windows looking towards the Tigris, by
moonlight; and he looked in that direction, and saw the light of
lamps and candles reflected in the river, and, turning his eyes up
towards the palace in the garden, he beheld it beaming with those
candles and lamps, and exclaimed, Bring hither to me Ja&#7841;far El-Barmekee!
In the twinkling of an eye, Ja&#7841;far stood before the Prince of
the Faithful; and the Khaleefeh said to him, O dog of Wezeers, dost
thou serve me and not acquaint me with what happeneth in the city
of Baghd&aacute;d?&mdash;What, asked Ja&#7841;far, is the occasion of these words?
The Khaleefeh answered, If the city of Baghd&aacute;d were not taken from
me, the Palace of Diversion were not enlivened with the light of the
lamps and candles, and its windows were not opened. Wo to thee!
Who could do these things unless the office of Khaleefeh were taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
from me?&mdash;Who, said Ja&#7841;far (the muscles of his side quivering from
fear), informed thee that the lamps and candles were lighted in the
Palace of Diversion, and that its windows were opened? The
Khaleefeh replied, Advance hither to me, and look. So Ja&#7841;far
approached the Khaleefeh, and, looking towards the garden, beheld
the palace as it were a flame of fire, its light surpassing that of the
moon. He desired, therefore, to make an excuse for the sheykh
Ibr&aacute;heem, the superintendent, thinking, from what he beheld, that the
event might have occurred through his permission: and accordingly
he said, O Prince of the Faithful, the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem last week said
to me, O my master Ja&#7841;far, I am desirous of entertaining my children
during my life and the life of the Prince of the Faithful.&mdash;And what,
said I, is thy design in saying this? He answered, It is my wish that
thou wouldst obtain for me permission from the Khaleefeh that I may
celebrate the circumcision of my sons in the palace. So I said, Do
what thou wilt with respect to the entertainment of thy sons, and, if
God will, I shall have an interview with the Khaleefeh, and will
acquaint him with it. And he left me thus; and I forgot to acquaint
thee.&mdash;O Ja&#7841;far, said the Khaleefeh, thou wast guilty of one offence
against me, and then thine offence became two: for thou hast erred in
two points: the first, thy not acquainting me with this affair; and the
second, thy not accomplishing the desire of the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem; for
he did not come to thee and address thee with these words but to hint
a request for some money by the aid of which to effect his design, and
thou neither gavest him anything nor acquaintedst me that I might
give him.&mdash;O Prince of the Faithful, replied Ja&#7841;far, I forgot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 451px; position: relative;"><a name="f161" id="f161"></a><img src="images/fig161.png" width="451" height="567" alt="The Khaleefeh and the Wezeer in the Tree" title="The Khaleefeh and the Wezeer in the Tree" /></div>

<p>The Khaleefeh then said, By my forefathers, I will not pass the
remainder of my night but with him, for he is a just man, who
frequenteth the sheykhs,<a href="#VI26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and attendeth to the poor, and favoureth
the indigent; and I imagine all his acquaintances are with him this
night; so I must repair to him: perhaps one of them may offer up for
us a prayer productive of good to us in this world and the next; and
probably some advantage may accrue to him from my presence, and he
will receive pleasure from this, together with his friends.&mdash;O Prince of
the Faithful, replied Ja&#7841;far, the greater part of the night hath passed,
and they are now about to disperse. But the Khaleefeh said, We
must go to them. And Ja&#7841;far was silent, and was perplexed in his
mind, not knowing what to do. So the Khaleefeh rose upon his feet,
and Ja&#7841;far rose and preceded him, and Mesroor the eunuch went
with them. The three walked on reflecting, and, departing from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
palace, proceeded through the streets, in the attire of merchants; until
they arrived at the gate of the garden above mentioned; and the
Khaleefeh, approaching it, found it open; and he was surprised, and
said, See, O Ja&#7841;far, how the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem hath left the gate open
until this hour, which is not his usual custom. They then entered,
and came to the end of the garden, where they stopped beneath the
palace; and the Khaleefeh said, O Ja&#7841;far, I desire to take a view of
them secretly before I go up to them, that I may see how the sheykhs
are occupied in the dispensing of their blessings and the employment
of their miraculous powers; for they have qualities which distinguish
them both in their private retirements and in their public exercises;
and now we hear not their voices, nor discover any indication of their
presence. Having thus said, he looked around, and, seeing a tall
walnut tree, he said, O Ja&#7841;far, I would climb this tree (for its branches
are near to the windows) and look at them. And accordingly he
ascended the tree, and climbed from branch to branch until he came
to that which was opposite to one of the windows, and there he sat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
and, looking in through this window of the palace, beheld a damsel
and a young man, like two moons (extolled be the perfection of Him
who created them!); and he saw the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem sitting with a
cup in his hand, and saying, O mistress of beauties, drinking unaccompanied
by merry sounds is not pleasant. Hast thou not heard the
saying of the poet?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Circulate it in the large cup, and in the small; and receive it from the hand of the shining moon:<a href="#VI27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span>
<span class="i0">And drink not without merry sounds; for I have observed that horses drink to the sound of whistling.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Khaleefeh witnessed this conduct of the sheykh
Ibr&aacute;heem, the vein of anger swelled between his eyes, and he
descended, and said, O Ja&#7841;far, I have never seen anything of the
miraculous performances of the just such as I have beheld this
night: ascend, therefore, thyself also, into this tree, and look, lest the
blessings of the just escape thee.<a href="#VI28" class="fnanchor">28</a>&mdash;On hearing the words of the
Prince of the Faithful, Ja&#7841;far was perplexed at his situation; and he
climbed up into the tree, and looked, and saw Noor-ed-Deen and the
sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem and the damsel, and the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem had the
cup in his hand. As soon as he beheld this, he made sure of destruction;
and he descended, and stood before the Prince of the Faithful,
and the Khaleefeh said, O Ja&#7841;far, praise be to God who hath made us
to be of the number of those who follow the external ordinances of the
holy law, and averted from us the sin of disguising ourselves by the
practice of hypocrisy! But Ja&#7841;far was unable to reply, from his
excessive confusion. The Khaleefeh then looked towards him, and
said, Who can have brought these persons hither, and admitted them
into my palace? But the like of this young man and this damsel, in
beauty and loveliness and symmetry of form, mine eye hath never
beheld.&mdash;Ja&#7841;far, now conceiving a hope that the Khaleefeh might be
propitiated, replied, Thou hast spoken truly, O Prince of the Faithful.
And the Khaleefeh said, O Ja&#7841;far, climb up with us upon this branch
which is opposite them, that we may amuse ourselves by observing them.
So they both climbed up into the tree, and, looking at them, heard
the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem say, O my mistress, I have relinquished decorum
by the drinking of wine; but the pleasure of this is not complete
without the melodious sounds of stringed instruments.&mdash;O sheykh
Ibr&aacute;heem, replied Enees-el-Jelees, by Allah, if we had any musical
instrument, our happiness were perfect. And when the sheykh
Ibr&aacute;heem heard her words, he rose upon his feet.&mdash;The Khaleefeh said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
to Ja&#7841;far, What may he be going to do? Ja&#7841;far replied, I know not.&mdash;And
the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem went away, and returned with a lute;
and the Khaleefeh, looking attentively at it, saw that it was the lute
of Is-&#7717;&aacute;&#7731;, the cup-companion; and said, By Allah, if this damsel sing
not well, I will crucify you all; but if she sing well, I will pardon
them, and crucify thee. So Ja&#7841;far said, O Allah, let her not sing
well!&mdash;Why? asked the Khaleefeh.&mdash;That thou mayest crucify all of
us, answered Ja&#7841;far; and then we shall cheer one another by conversation.
And the Khaleefeh laughed: and the damsel took the lute,
and tuned its strings, and played upon it in a manner that would
melt iron, and inspire an idiot with intellect; after which she sang
with such sweetness that the Khaleefeh exclaimed, O Ja&#7841;far, never in
my life have I heard so enchanting a voice as this!&mdash;Perhaps, said
Ja&#7841;far, the anger of the Khaleefeh hath departed from him?&mdash;Yea, he
answered; it hath departed. He then descended with Ja&#7841;far from the
tree, and, looking towards him, said, I am desirous of going up to
them, to sit with them, and to hear the damsel sing before me.&mdash;O
Prince of the Faithful, replied Ja&#7841;far, if thou go up to them, probably
they will be troubled by thy presence; and as to the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem,
he will assuredly die of fear. The Khaleefeh therefore said, O Ja&#7841;far,
thou must acquaint me with some stratagem by means of which I may
learn the truth of the affair without their knowing that I have discovered
them. And he and Ja&#7841;far walked towards the Tigris, reflecting upon
this matter; and lo, a fisherman stood beneath the windows of the
palace, and he threw his net, hoping to catch something by means of
which to obtain his subsistence.&mdash;Now the Khaleefeh had, on a former
occasion, called to the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, and said to him, What was
that noise that I heard beneath the windows of the palace?&mdash;and he
answered, The voices of the fishermen, who are fishing:&mdash;so he said,
Go down and forbid them from coming to this place. They were therefore
forbidden to come thither; but this night there came a fisherman
named Kereem, and, seeing the garden-gate open, he said within himself,
This is a time of inadvertence, and perhaps I may catch some fish
on this occasion:&mdash;so he took his net, and threw it into the river, and
then recited some verses, contrasting the condition of the poor fisherman,
toiling throughout the night, with that of the lord of the palace,
who, awaking from a pleasant slumber, findeth the fawn in his possession;
and as soon as he had finished his recitation, lo, the Khaleefeh,
unattended, stood at his head. The Khaleefeh knew him, and
exclaimed, O Kereem!&mdash;and the fisherman, hearing him call him by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
his name, turned towards him; and when he beheld the Khaleefeh,
the muscles of his side quivered, and he said, By Allah, O Prince of
the Faithful, I did not this in mockery of the mandate; but poverty
and the wants of my family impelled me to the act of which thou art
witness. The Khaleefeh replied, Throw thy net for my luck. And
the fisherman advanced, rejoicing exceedingly, and cast the net, and,
having waited until it had attained its limit and become steady at the
bottom, drew it in again, and there came up in it a variety of fish that
could not be numbered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px; position: relative;"><a name="f162" id="f162"></a><img src="images/fig162.png" width="431" height="478" alt="Kereem, the Fisherman" title="Kereem, the Fisherman" /></div>

<p>The Khaleefeh was delighted at this, and said, O Kereem, strip off
thy clothes:&mdash;and he did so. He was clad in a jubbeh<a href="#VI29" class="fnanchor">29</a> in which
were a hundred patches of coarse woollen stuff, containing vermin of
the most abominable kind, and among them fleas in such numbers
that he might almost have been transported by their means over the
face of the earth; and he took from his head a turban which for three
years he had never unwound; but when he happened to find a piece
of rag he twisted it around it: and when he had taken off the jubbeh
and turban, the Khaleefeh pulled off from his own person two vests of
silk of Alexandria and Ba&#7841;labekk, and a melwa&#7789;ah<a href="#VI30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and a farajeeyeh,<a href="#VI31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
and said to the fisherman, Take these, and put them on. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
Khaleefeh then put on himself the fisherman's jubbeh and turban, and,
having drawn a lith&aacute;m<a href="#VI32" class="fnanchor">32</a> over his face, said to the fisherman, Go about
thy business;&mdash;and he kissed the feet of the Khaleefeh, and thanked
him, reciting these two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou hast granted me favours beyond my power to acknowledge, and completely satisfied all my wants.</span>
<span class="i0">I will thank thee, therefore, as long as I live; and when I die, my bones will thank thee in their grave.<a href="#VI33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But scarcely had he finished his verses, when the vermin overran the
person of the Khaleefeh, and he began to seize them with his right
hand and his left from his neck, and to throw them down; and he
exclaimed, O fisherman, wo to thee! What are these abundant vermin
in this jubbeh?&mdash;O my lord, he answered, at present they torment
thee; but when a week shall have passed over thee, thou wilt not feel
them, nor think of them. The Khaleefeh laughed, and said to him,
How can I suffer this jubbeh to remain upon me? The fisherman
replied, I wish to tell thee something; but I am ashamed, through
my awe of the Khaleefeh. Impart, said the Khaleefeh, what thou
hast to tell me. So he said to him, It hath occurred to my mind, O
Prince of the Faithful, that thou desirest to learn the art of fishing, in
order that thou mayest be master of a trade that may profit thee; and
if such be thy desire, this jubbeh is suitable to thee. And the
Khaleefeh laughed at his words.</p>

<p>The fisherman then went his way, and the Khaleefeh took the
basket of fish, and, having put upon it a little grass, went with it to
Ja&#7841;far, and stood before him; and Ja&#7841;far, thinking that he was Kereem
the fisherman, feared for him, and said, O Kereem, what brought thee
hither? Save thyself by flight; for the Khaleefeh is here this night.&mdash;And
when the Khaleefeh heard the words of Ja&#7841;far, he laughed
until he fell down upon his back. So Ja&#7841;far said, Perhaps thou art
our lord the Prince of the Faithful?&mdash;Yes, O Ja&#7841;far, answered the
Khaleefeh, and thou art my Wezeer, and I came with thee hither, and
thou knowest me not. How then should the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem know
me when he is drunk? Remain where thou art until I return to thee.&mdash;Ja&#7841;far
replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and the Khaleefeh advanced to
the door of the palace, and knocked. The sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem arose,
therefore, and said, Who is at the door? He answered, I, O sheykh
Ibr&aacute;heem. The sheykh said, Who art thou?&mdash;and the Khaleefeh
answered, I am Kereem the fisherman: I heard that there were guests
with thee, and have therefore brought thee some fish; for it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
excellent.&mdash;Now Noor-ed-Deen and the damsel were both fond of fish,
and when they heard the mention of it they rejoiced exceedingly, and
said, O my master, open to him, and let him come in to us with the
fish which he hath brought. So the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem opened the
door, and the Khaleefeh, in his fisherman's disguise, entered, and began
by salutation; and the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem said to him, Welcome to the
robber, the thief, the gambler! Come hither, and shew us the fish
which thou hast brought.&mdash;He therefore shewed it to them; and lo,
it was alive, and moving; and the damsel exclaimed, By Allah, O my
master, this fish is excellent! I wish it were fried!&mdash;By Allah, said
the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem, thou hast spoken truth. Then, addressing the
Khaleefeh, he said, O fisherman, I wish thou hadst brought this fish
fried. Arise, and fry it for us, and bring it.&mdash;On the head be thy
commands, replied the Khaleefeh: I will fry it, and bring it.&mdash;Be
quick, said they, in doing it.</p>

<p>The Khaleefeh therefore arose and ran back to Ja&#7841;far, and said, O
Ja&#7841;far, they want the fish fried.&mdash;O Prince of the Faithful, replied he,
give it me, and I will fry it. But the Khaleefeh said, By the tombs
of my ancestors, none shall fry it but myself; with my own hand will
I do it! He then repaired to the hut of the superintendent, and,
searching there, found in it everything that he required, the frying-pan,
and even the salt, and wild marjoram, and other things. So he
approached the fire-place, and put on the frying-pan, and fried it
nicely; and when it was done, he put it upon a banana-leaf, and
having taken from the garden some limes, he went up with the fish,
and placed it before them. The young man, therefore, and the
damsel and the sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem advanced and ate; and when they
had finished, they washed their hands, and Noor-ed-Deen said, By
Allah, O fisherman, thou hast done us a kindness this night. Then
putting his hand into his pocket, he took forth for him three pieces of
gold, of those which Senjer had presented to him when he was setting
forth on his journey, and said, O fisherman, excuse me; for, by Allah,
if I had known thee before the events that have lately happened to me,
I would have extracted the bitterness of poverty from thy heart: but
take this as accordant with my present circumstances. So saying, he
threw the pieces of gold to the Khaleefeh, who took them, and kissed
them,<a href="#VI34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and put them in his pocket. The object of the Khaleefeh in
doing this was only that he might hear the damsel sing: so he said to
him, Thou hast treated me with beneficence, and abundantly recompensed
me; but I beg of thy unbounded indulgence that this damsel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
may sing an air, that I may hear her. Noor-ed-Deen therefore said,
O Enees-el-Jelees! She replied, Yes.&mdash;By my life, said he, sing to
us something for the gratification of this fisherman; for he desireth to
hear thee. And when she had heard what her master said, she took
the lute, and tried it with her fingers, after she had twisted its pegs,
and sang to it these two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The fingers of many a fawn-like damsel have played upon the lute, and the soul hath been ravished by the touch.</span>
<span class="i0">She hath made the deaf to hear her songs; and the dumb hath exclaimed, Thou hast excelled in thy singing!</span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px; position: relative;"><a name="f163" id="f163"></a><img src="images/fig163.png" width="475" height="319" alt="Enees-el-Jelees playing on the Lute" title="Enees-el-Jelees playing on the Lute" /></div>

<p>Then she played again, in an extraordinary manner, so as to charm the
minds of her hearers, and sang the following couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We are honoured by your visiting our abode, and your splendour hath dispelled the darkness of the moonless night:</span>
<span class="i0">It is therefore incumbent upon me to perfume my dwelling with musk and rose-water and camphor.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon this, the Khaleefeh was affected with violent emotion, and
overcome by ecstasy, so that he was no longer master of himself from
excessive delight; and he began to exclaim, Allah approve thee!
Allah approve thee! Allah approve thee! So Noor-ed-Deen said to
him, O fisherman, have the damsel and her art in striking the chords
pleased thee?&mdash;Yea, by Allah! exclaimed the Khaleefeh. And Noor-ed-Deen
immediately said, She is bestowed upon thee as a present
from me, the present of a generous man who will not revoke his gift.
And he rose upon his feet, and took a melwa&#7789;ah, and threw it upon
the Khaleefeh in the fisherman's disguise, ordering him to depart with
the damsel. But she looked towards him, and said, O my master,
wilt thou part from me without bidding me farewell? If we must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
separated, pause while I take leave of thee.&mdash;And she recited the
following couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you depart from me, still your abode will be in my heart, in the recess of my bosom.</span>
<span class="i0">I implore the Compassionate to grant our reunion; and a boon such as this, God will grant to whom He pleaseth.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when she had finished, Noor-ed-Deen thus replied to her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She bade me farewell on the day of separation, saying, while she wept from the pain that it occasioned,</span>
<span class="i0">What wilt thou do after my departure?&mdash;Say this, I replied, unto him who will survive it.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Khaleefeh, when he heard this, was distressed at the thought of
separating them, and, looking towards the young man, he said to
him, O my master, art thou in fear on account of any crime, or art
thou in debt to any one? Noor-ed-Deen answered, By Allah, O
fisherman, a wonderful event, and an extraordinary adventure,
happened to me and this damsel: if it were engraved on the understanding,
it would be a lesson to him who would be admonished.&mdash;Wilt
thou not, rejoined the Khaleefeh, relate to us thy story, and
acquaint us with thy case? Perhaps thy doing so may be productive
of relief; for the relief of God is near.&mdash;So Noor-ed-Deen said, Wilt
thou hear our story in poetry or in prose?&mdash;Prose, answered the
Khaleefeh, is mere talk; and verse, words put together like pearls.
And Noor-ed-Deen hung down his head towards the ground, and then
related his story in a series of verses: but when he had finished, the
Khaleefeh begged him to explain his case more fully. He therefore
acquainted him with the whole of his circumstances from beginning to
end; and when the Khaleefeh understood the affair, he said to him,
Whither wouldst thou now repair? He answered, God's earth is
wide. The Khaleefeh then said to him, I will write for thee a letter
which thou shalt convey to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Mo&#7717;ammad the son of Suleym&aacute;n
Ez-Zeynee, and when he shall have read it, he will do thee no
injury.&mdash;Is there in the world, said Noor-ed-Deen, a fisherman who
correspondeth with Kings? Verily this is a thing that can never
be.&mdash;Thou hast spoken truly, rejoined the Khaleefeh; but I will
acquaint thee with the cause. Know that I read in the same school
with him, under a master, and I was his monitor; and after that,
prosperity was his lot, and he became a Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, while God made me
to be a fisherman: yet I have never sent to request anything of him,
but he hath performed my wish; and if I sent to him every day to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
request a thousand things of him, he would do what I asked. When
Noor-ed-Deen, therefore, heard his words, he said to him, Write, that
I may see. And he took an inkhorn and a pen, and wrote (after the
phrase, In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful).&mdash;To
proceed.&mdash;This letter is from H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed the son of El-Mahdee,
to his highness Mo&#7717;ammad the son of Suleym&aacute;n Ez-Zeynee,
who hath been encompassed by my beneficence, and whom I constituted
my viceroy of a portion of my dominions. I acquaint thee
that the bearer of this letter is Noor-ed-Deen the son of El-Fa&#7693;l the
son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n the Wezeer, and on his arrival in thy presence thou
shalt divest thyself of the regal authority, and seat him in thy place;
for I have appointed him to the office to which I formerly appointed
thee: so disobey not my commands: and peace be on thee.&mdash;He then
gave the letter to 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, who took it and kissed it and
put it in his turban, and immediately set forth on his journey.</p>

<p>The sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem now looked towards the Khaleefeh in his
fisherman's disguise, and said to him, O most contemptible of fishermen,
thou hast brought us two fish worth twenty half-dirhems,<a href="#VI35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and
received three pieces of gold, and desirest to take the slave also. But
when the Khaleefeh heard these words, he cried out at him, and made
a sign to Mesroor, who immediately discovered himself, and rushed in
upon him. Ja&#7841;far, meanwhile, had sent one of the attendants of the
garden to the porter of the palace to demand a suit of clothing of him
for the Prince of the Faithful; and the man went, and brought the
dress, and kissed the ground before the Khaleefeh, who took off and
gave to him that with which he was then clad, and put on this suit.
The sheykh Ibr&aacute;heem was sitting on a chair: the Khaleefeh paused to
see the result: and the sheykh was astounded, and began to bite the
ends of his fingers through his confusion, saying, Am I asleep or
awake? The Khaleefeh then looked at him, and said, O sheykh
Ibr&aacute;heem, what is this predicament in which thou art placed? And
upon this, the sheykh recovered from his intoxication, and, throwing
himself upon the ground, implored forgiveness: and the Khaleefeh
pardoned him; after which he gave orders that the damsel should be
conveyed to the palace where he resided; and when she had arrived
there, he appropriated to her a separate lodging, and appointed persons
to wait upon her, and said to her, Know that I have sent thy master
as Sul&#7789;&aacute;n of El-Ba&#7779;rah, and, if God please, I will despatch to him a
dress of honour, and send thee also to him with it.</p>

<p>As to Noor-ed-Deen, he continued his journey until he entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
El-Ba&#7779;rah, and went up to the palace of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, when he uttered a
loud cry, whereupon the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n desired him to approach; and when
he came into the presence of the King, he kissed the ground before
him, and produced the letter, and handed it to him. And as soon as
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n saw the superscription in the handwriting of the Prince of
the Faithful, he rose upon his feet, and, having kissed it three times,
said, I hear and pay obedience to God (whose name be exalted!) and
to the Prince of the Faithful. He then summoned before him the
four &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ees,<a href="#VI36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and the Emeers, and was about to divest himself of the
regal office: but, lo, the Wezeer El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee was
before him, and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n gave him the letter of the Prince of the
Faithful, and when he saw it, he rent it in pieces, and put it into his
mouth, and chewed it, and threw it down. The Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, enraged,
cried, Wo to thee! What hath induced thee to act thus?&mdash;He
answered, This man hath had no interview with the Khaleefeh nor
with his Wezeer; but is a young wretch, an artful devil, who, having
met with a paper containing the handwriting of the Khaleefeh, hath
counterfeited it, and written what he desired: wherefore then shouldst
thou abdicate the sovereignty, when the Khaleefeh hath not sent to
thee an envoy with a royal autographical mandate; for if this affair
were true, he had sent with him a Chamberlain or a Wezeer; but he
came alone.&mdash;What then is to be done? said the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n. The Wezeer
answered, Send away this young man with me, and I will take charge
of him, and despatch him in company with a Chamberlain to the city
of Baghd&aacute;d; and if his words be true, he will bring us a royal autographical
mandate and diploma of investiture; and if not true, they will
send him back to us with the Chamberlain, and I will take my revenge
upon my offender.</p>

<p>When the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n heard what the Wezeer said, it pleased him; and
the Wezeer took him away,<a href="#VI37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and cried out to the pages, who threw
down Noor-ed-Deen, and beat him until he became insensible. He
then ordered to put a chain upon his feet, and called to the jailer; and
when he came, he kissed the ground before him. This jailer was
named &#7730;u&#7789;ey&#7789;;<a href="#VI38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and the Wezeer said to him, O &#7730;u&#7789;ey&#7789;, I desire that
thou take this person, and cast him into one of the subterranean cells
which are in thy prison, and torture him night and day. The jailer
replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and he put Noor-ed-Deen into the prison,
and locked the door upon him; but after having done this, he gave
orders to sweep a ma&#7779;&#7789;abah within the door, and furnished it with a
prayer-carpet and a pillow, and seated Noor-ed-Deen upon it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
loosed his chain, and treated him with kindness. The Wezeer every
day sent to him, commanding him to beat him; and the jailer pretended
that he tortured him, while, on the contrary, he treated him
with benignity.</p>

<p>Thus he continued to do for forty days; and on the forty-first day,
there came a present from the Khaleefeh, and when the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n saw it,
it pleased him, and he conferred with the Wezeers upon the subject;
but one said, Perhaps this present was designed for the new Sul&#7789;&aacute;n.
Upon this, the Wezeer El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee remarked, It
were proper to have slain him on his arrival:&mdash;and the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n
exclaimed, Now thou hast reminded me of him, go down and bring
him, and I will strike off his head. The Wezeer replied, I hear and
obey:&mdash;and arose, saying, I desire to proclaim throughout the city,
He who wisheth to witness the decapitation of Noor-ed-Deen 'Alee
the son of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n, let him come to the palace:&mdash;so
that all the people may come to behold it, and I may gratify my
heart, and mortify my enviers. The Sul&#7789;&aacute;n said, Do what thou wilt.
So the Wezeer descended, full of joy and happiness, and went to the
W&aacute;lee, and ordered him to make this proclamation; and when the
people heard the crier, they all grieved and wept, even the boys in the
schools, and the tradesmen in their shops; and numbers of the people
strove together to take for themselves places where they might behold
the spectacle, while others repaired to the prison, to accompany him
thence. The Wezeer then went forth, attended by ten memlooks, to
the prison: and &#7730;u&#7789;ey&#7789; the jailer said to him, What dost thou desire,
O our lord the Wezeer?&mdash;Bring forth to me, said the Wezeer, this
young wretch. The jailer replied, He is in a most miserable state from
the excessive beating that I have inflicted upon him. And he entered,
and found him reciting some verses, commencing thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who is there to aid me in my affliction? For my pain hath become intense, and my remedy is scarce procurable!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the jailer pulled off from him his clean clothes, and, having clad
him in two dirty garments, brought him out to the Wezeer. Noor-ed-Deen
then looked at him, and saw that he was his enemy who had
incessantly desired his destruction; and when he beheld him, he wept,
and said to him, Art thou secure from misfortune? Hast thou not
heard the saying of the poet?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They made use of their power, and used it tyrannically; and soon it became as though it never had existed.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>O Wezeer, know that God (whose perfection be extolled, and whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
name be exalted!) is the doer of whatsover He willeth.&mdash;O 'Alee,
replied the Wezeer, wouldst thou frighten me by these words? I am
now going to strike off thy head, in spite of the people of El-Ba&#7779;rah;
and I will pay no regard to thy counsel; but I will rather attend to
the saying of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let fortune do whatever it willeth, and bear with cheerful mind the effects of fate.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>How excellent also is the saying of another poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He who liveth after his enemy a single day, hath attained his desire.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Wezeer then ordered his pages to convey him on the back of
a mule; whereupon they said to him (being distressed to obey), Suffer
us to stone him and cut him in pieces, though our lives should be
sacrificed in consequence. But he replied, Never do it. Have ye not
heard what the poet hath said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A decreed term is my inevitable lot; and as soon as its days have expired, I die.</span>
<span class="i0">If the lions dragged me into their forest, they could not close it while aught of it remained.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So they proceeded to proclaim before Noor-ed-Deen, This is the
smallest recompense of him who forgeth a letter from the Khaleefeh to
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n. And they continued to parade him throughout El-Ba&#7779;rah
until they stationed him beneath the window of the palace, and in the
place of blood,<a href="#VI39" class="fnanchor">39</a> when the executioner approached him, and said to him,
I am a slave under command; and if thou hast any want, acquaint me
with it, that I may perform it for thee; for there remaineth not of thy
life any more than the period until the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n shall put forth his face
from the window. And upon this, Noor-ed-Deen looked to the right
and left, and recited these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is there among you a merciful friend, who will aid me? I conjure you by Allah to answer me!</span>
<span class="i0">My life hath passed, and my death is at hand! Is there any who will pity me, to obtain my recompense,<a href="#VI40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span>
<span class="i0">And consider my state, and relieve my anguish, by a draught of water that my torment may be lightened?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the people were excited to tears for him; and the executioner took
some water to hand it to him; but the Wezeer arose from his place,
and struck the &#7731;ulleh<a href="#VI41" class="fnanchor">41</a> of water with his hand, and broke it, and called
to the executioner, commanding him to strike off his head; whereupon
he bound Noor-ed-Deen's eyes. The people, however, called out
against the Wezeer, and raised a tumultuous cry against him, and
many words passed between them; and while they were in this state,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
lo, a dust rose, and filled the sky and the open tracts; and when the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n beheld it, as he sat in the palace, he said to his attendants, See
what is the news. The Wezeer said, After thou shalt first have
beheaded this man. But the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n replied, Wait thou until we see
what is the news.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px; position: relative;"><a name="f164" id="f164"></a><img src="images/fig164.png" width="489" height="509" alt="Enees-el-Jelees and the Khaleefeh and Jaafar" title="Enees-el-Jelees and the Khaleefeh and Ja&#7841;far" /></div>

<p>Now this dust was the dust of Ja&#7841;far, the Wezeer of the Khaleefeh,
and of his attendants; and the cause of their coming was this:&mdash;The
Khaleefeh had passed thirty days without remembering the affair of
'Alee the son of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n, and no one mentioned it
to him, until he came one night to the private apartment of Enees-el-Jelees,
and heard her lamenting, as she recited, with a soft voice, the
saying of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thine image [is before me] whether distant or near, and my tongue never ceaseth to mention thee.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her lamentation increased, and lo, the Khaleefeh opened the door, and
entered the chamber, and saw Enees-el-Jelees weeping. On beholding
the Khaleefeh, she fell at his feet, and, having kissed them three times,
recited these two verses:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O thou of pure origin, and of excellent birth; of ripe-fruitful branch, and of unsullied race!</span>
<span class="i0">I remind thee of the promise thy beneficence granted, and far be it from thee that thou shouldst forget it.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Khaleefeh said to her, Who art thou? She answered, I am the
present given to thee by 'Alee the son of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n;
and I request the fulfilment of the promise which thou gavest me, that
thou wouldst send me to him with the honorary gift; for I have now
been here thirty days, and have not tasted sleep. And upon this, the
Khaleefeh summoned Ja&#7841;far El-Barmekee, and said to him, For thirty
days I have heard no news of 'Alee the son of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of
Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n, and I imagine nothing less than that the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n hath killed
him: but, by my head! by the tombs of my ancestors! if any evil
event hath happened to him, I will destroy him who hath been the
cause of it, though he be the dearest of men in my estimation! I
desire, therefore, that thou journey immediately to El-Ba&#7779;rah, and
bring me an account of the conduct of the King Mo&#7717;ammad the son of
Suleym&aacute;n Ez-Zeynee to 'Alee the son of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;&#7731;&aacute;n.</p>

<p>So Ja&#7841;far obeyed his commands, and set forth on his journey, and
when he approached, and saw this tumult and crowd, he said, What is
the occasion of this crowd? They related to him, therefore, the situation
in which they were with regard to Noor-ed-Deen; and when he
heard their words, he hastened to go up to the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and, having
saluted him, acquainted him with the cause of his coming, and told
him, that if any evil event had happened to 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, the
Khaleefeh would destroy him who was the cause of it. He then
arrested the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n, and the Wezeer El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee, and
gave orders to liberate 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, and enthroned him as
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n in the place of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Mo&#7717;ammad the son of Suleym&aacute;n
Ez-Zeynee; after which he remained in El-Ba&#7779;rah three days, the
usual period of entertainment; and on the morning of the fourth day,
'Alee Noor-ed-Deen said to Ja&#7841;far, I have a longing desire to see the
Prince of the Faithful. So Ja&#7841;far said to the King Mo&#7717;ammad the
son of Suleym&aacute;n, Prepare thyself for travelling; for we will perform
the morning-prayers, and depart to Baghd&aacute;d. He replied, I hear and
obey:&mdash;and they performed the morning-prayers, and mounted all
together, with the Wezeer El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee, who now
repented of what he had done. As to 'Alee Noor-ed-Deen, he rode by
the side of Ja&#7841;far: and they continued their journey until they arrived
at Baghd&aacute;d, the Abode of Peace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span></p>

<p>They then presented themselves before the Khaleefeh, and related
to him the case of Noor-ed-Deen; whereupon the Khaleefeh addressed
him, saying, Take this sword, and strike off with it the head of thine
enemy. And he took it, and approached El-Mo'een the son of S&aacute;wee;
but he looked at him, and said to him, I did according to my nature,
and do thou according to thine. And Noor-ed-Deen threw down the
sword from his hand, and, looking towards the Khaleefeh, said, O
Prince of the Faithful, he hath beguiled me. So the Khaleefeh said,
Do thou leave him:&mdash;and he said to Mesroor, O Mesroor, advance
thou, and strike off his head. Mesroor, therefore, did so: and upon
this, the Khaleefeh said to 'Alee the son of El-Fa&#7693;l the son of Kh&aacute;k&aacute;n,
Request of me what thou wilt. He replied, O my lord, I have no
want of the sovereignty of El-Ba&#7779;rah, and desire nothing but to have
the honour of serving thee.&mdash;Most willingly I assent, said the
Khaleefeh:&mdash;and he summoned the damsel, and when she had come
before him, he bestowed favours upon them both: he gave to them
one of the palaces of Baghd&aacute;d, and assigned to them regular allowances,
and made Noor-ed-Deen one of his companions at the table;
and he remained with him until death overtook him.</p>

<h5>NOTES TO CHAPTER SIXTH.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI1" id="VI1">1.</a></span> In the old version, the person here named Enees-el-Jelees is called "The
Fair Persian;" but I do not find her so described in any copy of the original. The
name here given to her may be rendered "the Companion's Cheerer;" "Enees" being
a term applied to any person or thing serving as an agreeable, cheering companion;
and "Jelees" signifying "a companion," or "one in the habit of sitting with another."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI2" id="VI2">2.</a></span> "Kha&#7789;&#7789;eeyeh" is derived from "kha&#7789;&#7789;," which signifies "writing," but
which is also the name of a place (Kha&#7789;&#7789; Hejer) in the province of El-Ba&#7717;reyn, a
famous mart for spears. Of the figure of speech employed in the couplet in which this
word occurs (considered by the Arabs an elegant mode of &aelig;tiology, and called by them
"&#7717;osn et-ta&#7841;leel") my sheykh gives the following example in a marginal note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And the rain fell not but for the purpose of kissing the ground before thee."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI3" id="VI3">3.</a></span> "El-Mo'een" signifies "the Aider," or "the Assistant."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI4" id="VI4">4.</a></span> "El-Fa&#7693;l," signifying "the Excellence," is here, as a proper name, an
abbreviation of "Fa&#7693;l-ed-Deen," "the Excellence of the Religion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI5" id="VI5">5.</a></span> This phrase (a person of auspicious aspect<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a>) is often used by the modern
Arabs and the Turks, and signifies "a virtuous or beneficent man."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI6" id="VI6">6.</a></span> This answer is not to be understood in its literal sense; it has become a
common form of speech which an Arab often uses for the purpose of obtaining something
more than he would venture to demand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI7" id="VI7">7.</a></span> "May it be favourable," or "&mdash;&mdash;beneficial," is a compliment usually
addressed to a person who has just been to the bath, and to a man who has just had his
head shaved. The reply is, "May God bestow favours upon thee."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI8" id="VI8">8.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Law respecting Murder and unintentional Homicide.</i> The &#7730;ur-&aacute;n
ordains that murder shall be punished with death; or, rather, that the free shall die for
the free, the slave for the slave, and a woman for a woman; or that the perpetrator of
the crime shall pay, to the heirs of the person whom he has killed, if they will allow it,
a fine, which is to be divided according to the laws of inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> It also ordains, that
unintentional homicide shall be expiated by freeing a believer from slavery, and paying,
to the family of the person killed, a fine, unless they remit it.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> But these laws are
amplified and explained by the same book and by the Im&aacute;ms.&mdash;A fine is not to be
accepted for murder unless the crime has been attended by some palliating circumstance.
This fine, the price of blood, is a hundred camels; or a thousand deen&aacute;rs
(about 500<i>l.</i>) from him who possesses gold; or, from him who possesses silver, twelve
thousand dirhems<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> (about 300<i>l.</i>). This is for killing a free man; for a woman, half
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>that sum; for a slave, his or her value, but that must fall short of the price of blood for
the free. A person unable to free a believer must fast two months as in Rama&#7693;&aacute;n.
The accomplices of a murderer are liable to the punishment of death. By the Sunneh
also, a man is obnoxious to capital punishment for the murder of a woman; and by the
&#7716;anafee law, for the murder of another man's slave. But he is exempted from this
punishment who kills his own child or other descendant, or his own slave, or his son's
slave, or a slave of whom he is part-owner: so also are his accomplices: and according
to Esh-Sh&aacute;fe'ee, a Muslim, though a slave, is not to be put to death for killing an infidel,
though the latter be free. A man who kills another in self-defence, or to defend his
property from a robber, is exempt from all punishment. The price of blood is a debt
incumbent on the family, tribe, or association, of which the homicide is a member. It
is also incumbent on the inhabitants of an enclosed quarter, or the proprietor or proprietors
of a field, in which the body of a person killed by an unknown hand is found;
unless the person has been found killed in his own house.</p>

<p>Hence it appears, that the punishment with which the Wezeer El-Fa&#7693;l threatened
his son is not to be regarded as a grave criminal act; especially when we consider the
nature of the son's offence: for the slave was the property of the king, and it was not
allowable to any other man even to see her without his permission. Many of the characters
depicted in the present work would seem incongruous in the extreme, if judged
according to European notions of justice and other moral qualities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI9" id="VI9">9.</a></span> "The two professions of the faith," "There is no deity but God," and
"Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle," are generally repeated by a dying Muslim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI10" id="VI10">10.</a></span> This is said to imply (as my sheykh has remarked in a marginal note)
that El-Fa&#7693;l was a charitable person who bestowed pensions upon the professors of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n and of science. There are many among the modern Muslims who do so, and
numbers also who found and endow public schools.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI11" id="VI11">11.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Washing, Shrouding, and Burial of the Dead.</i> The ceremonies
attendant upon death and burial are nearly the same in the cases of men and women.
The face or the head of the dying person is turned towards the direction of Mekkeh.
When the spirit is departing, the eyes are closed; and then, or immediately after, the
women of the house commence a loud lamentation, in which many of the females of the
neighbourhood generally come to join. Hired female mourners are also usually employed;
each of whom accompanies her exclamations of "Alas for him!" &amp;c., by beating a tambourine.
If possible, the corpse is buried on the day of the death; but when this
cannot be done, the lamentation of the women is continued during the ensuing night;
and a recitation of several chapters, or of the whole, of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is performed by one
or more men hired for the purpose.</p>

<p>The washing consists, first, in the performance of the ordinary ablution which is
preparatory to prayer, with the exception of the cleansing of the mouth and nose; and
secondly, in an ablution of the whole body with warm water and soap, or with water in
which some leaves of the lote-tree have been boiled. The jaw is bound up, the eyes are
closed, and the nostrils &amp;c., are stuffed with cotton; and the corpse is sprinkled with a
mixture of water, pounded camphor, dried and pounded leaves of the lote-tree, and
sometimes other dried and pulverized leaves, &amp;c., and with rose-water. The ankles are
bound together; and the hands placed upon the breast.</p>

<p>The grave-clothing of a poor man consists of a piece or two of cotton, or a kind of
bag: but the corpse of a man of wealth is generally wrapped first in muslin; then, in
cotton cloth of a thicker texture; next, in a piece of striped stuff of silk and cotton
intermixed, or in a &#7731;af&#7789;&aacute;n (a long vest) of similar stuff, merely stitched together; and
over these is wrapped a Kashmeer shawl. The colours most approved for the grave-clothes
are white and green. The body thus shrouded is placed in a bier, which is
usually covered with a Kashmeer shawl, and borne on the shoulders of three or four
men, generally friends of the deceased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span></p>

<p>There are some slight differences in the funeral-ceremonies observed in different
Arab countries; but a sufficient notion of them will be conveyed by briefly describing
those which prevail in Cairo. The procession to the tomb is generally headed by a
number of poor men, mostly blind, who, walking two and two, or three and three,
together, chant, in a melancholy tone, the profession (or two professions) of the faith,
mentioned above (in Note 9), or sometimes other words. They are usually followed by
some male relations and friends of the deceased; and these, by a group of schoolboys,
chanting in a higher tone, and one of them bearing a copy of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, or of one of
its thirty sections, placed upon a kind of desk formed of palm-sticks, and covered with
an embroidered kerchief. Then follows the bier, borne head-foremost. Friends of the
deceased relieve one another in the office of carrying it; and casual passengers often
take part in this service, which is esteemed highly meritorious. Behind the bier walk
the female mourners, composing a numerous group, often more than a dozen; or, if of
a wealthy family, they ride. Each of those who belong to the family of the deceased
has a strip of cotton stuff or muslin, generally blue, bound round her head, over the
head-veil, and carries a handkerchief, usually dyed blue (the colour of mourning), which
she sometimes holds over her shoulders, and at other times twirls with both hands over
her head or before her face, while she cries and shrieks almost incessantly; and the
hired female mourners, accompanying the group, often celebrate the praises of the
deceased in the manner described in the preceding tale, though this was forbidden by
the Prophet.&mdash;The funeral-procession of a man of wealth is sometimes preceded by
several camels, bearing bread and water to give to the poor at the tomb; and closed by
the led horses of some of the attendants, and by a buffalo or other animal to be sacrificed
at the tomb, where its flesh is distributed to the poor, to atone for some of the
minor sins of the deceased.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>The bier used for conveying the corpse of a boy or a female has a cover of wood, over
which a shawl is spread; and at the head is an upright piece of wood: upon the upper
part of this, in the case of a boy, is fixed a turban, with several ornaments of female
head-dress; and in the case of a female, it is similarly decked, but without the turban.</p>

<p>A short prayer is recited over the dead, either in a mosque or in a place particularly
dedicated to this service in, or adjacent to, the burial-ground. The body is then
conveyed, in the same manner as before, to the tomb. This is a hollow, oblong vault,
one side of which faces the direction of Mekkeh, generally large enough to contain four
or more bodies, and having an oblong monument of stone or brick constructed over it,
with a stela at the head and foot. Upon the former of these two stel&aelig; (which is often
inscribed with a text from the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and the name of the deceased, with the date of
his death), a turban, cap, or other head-dress, is sometimes carved, shewing the rank or
class of the person or persons buried beneath; and in many cases, a cupola supported
by four walls, or by columns, &amp;c., is constructed over the smaller monument. The
body is laid on its right side, or inclined by means of a few crude bricks, so that the
face is turned towards Mekkeh; and a person is generally employed to dictate to the
deceased the answers which he should give when he is examined by the two angels
Munkar and Nekeer, whom I have mentioned in No. 21 of the Notes to the Introduction.
If the funeral be that of a person of rank or wealth, the bread and water &amp;c. before
mentioned are then distributed to the poor.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<p>The principal ceremonies observed <i>after</i> the funeral have been described in Note 15
to Chapter iv.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI12" id="VI12">12.</a></span> "The lord (or chief) of the first and the last among mankind" is one of
the many appellations of honour given by the Muslims to their Prophet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI13" id="VI13">13.</a></span> My sheykh remarks, that this is said merely to excite men to generosity;
for literally it is not true, as is shown by the memorable example of Ka&#7841;b the son of
M&aacute;meh, who preferred giving the water with which he was provided to another, and in
consequence himself died of thirst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI14" id="VI14">14.</a></span> We are not to understand that such a slave as Enees-el-Jelees was
exposed to the public gaze in a market to which all persons indiscriminately were
admitted (for this would be at variance with Eastern usages); but in a special mart
to which none were allowed access but persons of wealth who expressed a desire to
purchase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI15" id="VI15">15.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Kissing the Ground, as a Mode of Obeisance.</i> This and several other
passages in the present work shew that we are often to understand the expression
"kissing the ground before a person" as signifying "touching the ground, and then
the lips and forehead, or turban, with the right hand;" and I believe this expression
should <i>generally</i> be so understood. When I wrote the fourteenth note to the Introduction,
I inclined to a contrary opinion, chiefly from recollecting to have read the following
translation of a passage of El-Ma&#7731;reezee, by the learned De Sacy:&mdash;"Ce khalife
[El-&#7716;&aacute;kim] ordonna qu'&agrave; l'avenir on ne baiseroit plus la terre devant lui; que personne,
en le saluant dans les marches publiques, ne baiseroit sa main ou son etrier, parce que
cette coutume de se <i>prosterner</i> devant une cr&eacute;ature &eacute;toit une invention des Grecs."<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>
But on referring to the original, I find that the words which he renders "cette coutume
de se prosterner" signify literally "the bending towards the ground." I suppose,
therefore, that his deviating from the literal sense in one case was owing to his adhering
to it in another; and not meeting with the proof which I had fancied to exist of his
being right, I venture to differ from him in this instance, without fear of being suspected
of arrogance, as the kind of obeisance above described is <i>often</i> called "kissing the
ground" both by the Arabs and the Persians. I should add that, except in the
house, I do not remember to have ever seen the ground actually touched, but nearly so,
in making this obeisance, which is still called "kissing the ground" when thus imperfectly
performed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI16" id="VI16">16.</a></span> By this is meant, a place where mud was kneaded to be employed in
building. The mortar generally used in the construction of Arab houses is composed of
mud in the proportion of one-half, with a fourth part of lime, and the remaining part
of the ashes of straw and rubbish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI18" id="VI18">18.</a></span> In Arabic, "bursh." This kind of mat, composed of palm-leaves (and
sometimes, I believe, of the coarse grass mentioned in the next note), is used by the
poor to sit upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI19" id="VI19">19.</a></span> This kind of grass, called in Arabic "&#7717;alfeh," and more properly "&#7717;alf&agrave;"
(by botanists, poa multiflora, and poa cynosyro&iuml;des), and the "'&aacute;&#7731;ool" (or hedysarum
alhagi), overspread spontaneously most of the alluvial tracts in Egypt which are above
the reach of the inundation, and in consequence left uncultivated. The former is used
in the manufacture of coarse mats, and the latter serves as pasture for camels. The
Wezeer, by taking the round mat and the two bundles of &#7717;alf&agrave;, seems to indicate that
he is degraded to a condition as low as that of a maker of coarse mats. [The practice
mentioned in the passage to which this note refers is aptly illustrated in El-Ma&#7731;reezee's
Khi&#7789;a&#7789;. In his description of the palaces of the F&aacute;&#7789;imee Khaleefehs, he says,
"There was in the Great Palace a place known by the name of the Sa&#7731;eefeh, where
complainants of injustice used to station themselves; and it was a custom of the Khaleefeh
to sit there every night, for those of the complainants of injustice who might come to him.
When any one, therefore, was wronged, he would stand under the Sa&#7731;eefeh, and say, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>a loud voice, 'There is no deity but God, Mo&#7717;ammad is the Apostle of God, 'Alee is the
Friend (Welee) of God;' and the Khaleefeh would hear him, and command him to be
brought to him, or he would intrust his case to the Wezeer," &amp;c.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI20" id="VI20">20.</a></span> The boats used by the Arabs in the navigation of rivers are generally

head became general among the Arabs of the towns; but from a remark of Es-Suyoo&#7789;ee,
I think it was not so common about the commencement of the tenth century
of the Flight (that is, about the period which this work best illustrates) as it is at
present, when it is almost universal among all classes; for in his time, its legality was
doubted. He writes thus:&mdash;"The Im&aacute;n El-Ghaz&aacute;lee hath said, 'There is no harm in
it in the case of him whose object is cleanliness:' and the apparent sense of his words
is, that it is improper in him who desireth to beautify himself for any worldly purpose,
as is done by people of bad disposition."<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> It is added in a marginal note in the copy
from which I translate this, "Persons differ respecting the shaving of the head. The
opinion generally prevailing is, that it is improper to him who wears not a turban, and
allowable to him who does wear one, since he has a substitute:"&mdash;"that it is also lawful,
unquestionably, in the case of any disease of the head:"&mdash;and "that the hanging of the
rosary to the neck, and the shaving of the head without a legal necessity, are innovations,"&mdash;H&aacute;roon
Er-Rasheed generally wore the hair of his head sufficiently long to
reach below his ears; but shaved it when he performed the pilgrimage;<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> and many
other Muslims in early times did the same. Those who shave the head generally leave
a small tuft upon the crown; but most persons of the literary and religious professions,
and many others, disapprove of this tuft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI26" id="VI26">26.</a></span> By the term "sheykhs" we are here to understand "persons of sanctity
and of learning." See Note 9 to Chapter i.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI27" id="VI27">27.</a></span> By "the shining moon" is meant "the beautiful cup-bearer, whose face
is like the shining moon."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI28" id="VI28">28.</a></span> The Muslims believe that a blessing is derived from witnessing and hearing
the devout exercises, recitations, &amp;c., of holy men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI29" id="VI29">29.</a></span> The "jubbeh" worn in Eastern countries, is a long outer vest, with
sleeves which reach nearly to the wrist. It is now generally made of cloth, and is worn
by most tradesmen and other persons of the middle and higher classes. It differs
somewhat in form in different countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI30" id="VI30">30.</a></span> The "melwa&#7789;ah" is a garment of which I was unable to obtain a
description until I inquired of my friend Mr. Salam&eacute;, who informed me that it was the
name of a large outer garment which used to be worn over the farajeeyeh. But I
afterwards found it stated in one of the marginal notes to a later tale, that the term
above mentioned is now pronounced "melloo&#7789;ah," and is applied in the present day to
an article of dress of cloth or other costly material; particularly to a jubbeh; but that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>it is also employed, in allusion to a jubbeh, &amp;c., in a contemptuous sense, or, as I infer,
ironically.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI31" id="VI31">31.</a></span> See Note 41 to Chapter iv.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI32" id="VI32">32.</a></span> The "lith&aacute;m" is a piece of drapery with which a Bedawee often covers
the lower part of his face. It frequently prevents his being recognised by another Arab
who might make him a victim of blood-revenge; and is a means of disguise seldom
employed but by Arabs of the desert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI33" id="VI33">33.</a></span> The meaning is, that the act would speak for itself, and be long remembered;
that the grave of the fisherman would be pointed out as that of one to whom
the Khaleefeh had shewn signal favours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI34" id="VI34">34.</a></span> It is a common custom of Arabs of the lower orders to put the money
which they receive, especially when it is the first of the day's gains, to the lips and
forehead before depositing it in the pocket; and the same is sometimes done by persons
of the middle class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI35" id="VI35">35.</a></span> Literally, "twenty nu&#7779;fs." See Note 17 to Chapter iii.</p>

edition.</p>

a "he-cat."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VI39" id="VI39">39.</a></span> The words which I translate "the place of blood" literally signify "the
place of the stagnation of blood;" and are applied to the usual place of decapitation,

<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<h6>COMMENCING WITH PART OF THE THIRTY-SIXTH NIGHT, AND ENDING
WITH PART OF THE FORTY-FOURTH.</h6>

<hr />
<h5>THE STORY OF GH&Aacute;NIM THE SON OF EIYOOB, THE DISTRACTED
SLAVE OF LOVE.</h5>

<p>It hath been told me, O happy King, said Shahraz&aacute;d, that there
was, in ancient times, a certain merchant of Damascus,<a href="#VII1" class="fnanchor">1</a> possessed of
wealth, who had a son like the moon at the full, of eloquent tongue,
called Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob,<a href="#VII2" class="fnanchor">2</a> the Distracted Slave of Love; and
this son had a sister, named Fitneh,<a href="#VII3" class="fnanchor">3</a> on account of her excessive beauty
and loveliness. Their father died, leaving them large property, among
which were a hundred loads<a href="#VII4" class="fnanchor">4</a> of silk and brocade, and bags<a href="#VII5" class="fnanchor">5</a> of musk,
and upon these loads was written, This is intended for Baghd&aacute;d:&mdash;it
having been his desire to journey to that city.</p>

<p>So, when God (whose name be exalted!) had taken his soul, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
some time had elapsed, his son took these loads, and journeyed with
them to Baghd&aacute;d.&mdash;This was in the time of H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed.&mdash;He
took leave of his mother and relations and townspeople before his
departure, and went forth, placing his dependence upon God (whose
name be exalted!), and God decreed him safety, so that he arrived at
Baghd&aacute;d, whither there travelled in his company a party of merchants.
He hired for himself a handsome house, and furnished it with carpets
and cushions, and suspended curtains in it; and there he deposited
those loads, together with the mules and camels, and remained until
he had rested himself; and the merchants of Baghd&aacute;d, and its great
men, came and saluted him. He then took a wrapper containing ten
pieces of costly stuff, with the prices written upon them, and went
forth with them to the market of the merchants, who met him and
saluted him, treated him with honour and welcomed him, and seated
him at the shop of the Sheykh of the market; and he sold the pieces,
gaining, for every piece of gold, two. So Gh&aacute;nim rejoiced; and he
proceeded to sell the stuffs by little and little, and continued to do so
for a whole year.</p>

<p>After this, on the first day of the following year, he came to the
same market, but found its gate shut, and, inquiring the cause of this,
he was answered, One of the merchants hath died, and all the rest of
them have gone to walk in his funeral-procession. Wilt thou then,
added his informant, gain a recompense<a href="#VII6" class="fnanchor">6</a> by walking with them?&mdash;He
replied, Yes;&mdash;and he asked respecting the place of the funeral. So
they guided him thither; and he performed the ablution,<a href="#VII7" class="fnanchor">7</a> and walked
with the other merchants until they arrived at the place of prayer,
where they prayed over the dead. The merchants then walked all
together before the corpse to the burial-ground, Gh&aacute;nim following
them, until the procession arrived at the burial-ground outside the
city, and they proceeded among the tombs until they came to that in
which the corpse was to be deposited. They found that the family of
the deceased had pitched a tent over the tomb, and placed there the
candles and lamps; and they buried the dead, and the readers sat
reciting the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n at the tomb. The merchants sat with them; and
so also did Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob; but he was overcome by bashfulness,
saying within himself, I cannot quit them until I have departed
with them. They sat listening to the recitation of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n until
the period of nightfall, when the servants placed before them the
supper and sweetmeats, and they ate till they were satisfied, and washed
their hands, and resumed their seats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span></p>

<p>The heart of Gh&aacute;nim was now troubled with reflections upon his
merchandize, and he was fearful of the thieves, and said within himself,
I am a stranger, and suspected of possessing wealth, and if I pass
the night far away from my abode, the thieves will steal the money and
the loads. So, fearing for his property, he arose and went forth from
among the company, asking their leave to depart on account of some
business that he had to transact, and followed the beaten track until
he came to the gate of the city: but it was then midnight, and he
found the gate of the city shut, and saw no one coming or going, and
heard not a sound save the barking of the dogs, and the howling of
the wolves; whereupon he exclaimed, There is no strength nor power
but in God! I was in fear for my property, and came hither on
account of it, and have found the gate shut, and now I have become
in fear for my life!&mdash;He then returned to seek for himself a place in
which to sleep until the morning: and, finding a private burial-place
enclosed by four walls, with a palm-tree within it, and a gate-way of
hard stone, open, he entered it, and desired to sleep; but sleep came
not to him.</p>

<p>Tremor and gloom overcame him, thus lying among the tombs,
and he rose upon his feet, and, opening the door, looked out, and
beheld a light gleaming in the distance in the direction of the city-gate
He advanced a few steps, and saw the light approaching in the
way which led to the burial-place in which he was taking refuge;
whereupon Gh&aacute;nim feared for himself, and hastily closed the door, and
climbed up into the palm-tree, and concealed himself in the midst of
its branches. The light continued to approach the tomb by little and
little until it came very near; and as he looked attentively at it, he
perceived three black slaves, two of whom were bearing a chest, the
other having in his hand an adze and a lantern; and as they drew
near, one of the two slaves who were bearing the chest said, What aileth
thee, O &#7778;aw&aacute;b?<a href="#VII8" class="fnanchor">8</a>&mdash;to which the other of the two replied, What aileth
thee, O K&aacute;foor?<a href="#VII9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The former rejoined, Were we not here at the hour
of nightfall, and did we not leave the door open?&mdash;Yes, answered the
other: what thou sayest is true.&mdash;See then, resumed the first speaker,
it is shut and barred.&mdash;Upon this, the third, who was carrying the
adze and light, and whose name was Bakheet,<a href="#VII10" class="fnanchor">10</a> said, How small is
your sense! Know ye not that the owners of the gardens go forth
from Baghd&aacute;d and repair hither, and, evening overtaking them, enter
this place, and shut the door upon themselves, through fear, lest the
blacks, like ourselves, should take them and roast them and eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
them?<a href="#VII11" class="fnanchor">11</a>&mdash;Thou hast spoken truth, they answered; but there is none
among us of less sense than thyself.&mdash;Verily, he replied, ye will not
believe me until we enter the burial-place and find some one in it: and
I imagine that, if any one be in it, and have seen the light, he hath
betaken himself to the top of the palm-tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px; position: relative;"><a name="f169" id="f169"></a><img src="images/fig169.png" width="414" height="518" alt="Gh&aacute;nim in the Palm-tree" title="Gh&aacute;nim in the Palm-tree" /></div>

<p>When Gh&aacute;nim heard these words of the slave, he said within himself,
How cunning is this slave! May Allah disgrace the blacks for
their malice and villainy! There is no strength nor power but in God,
the High, the Great! What will deliver me from this difficulty?&mdash;The
two who were bearing the chest then said to him who had the
adze, Climb over the wall, and open to us the door, O Bakheet; for
we are fatigued with carrying the chest upon our necks: and if thou
open to us the door, we will give thee one of the persons whom we
take, and we will fry him for thee excellently, so that not a drop of his
fat shall be lost. But he replied, I am afraid of a thing that my
little sense hath suggested to me: let us throw over the chest behind
the door; for it is our deposite. They said to him, If we throw it, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
will break.&mdash;I am afraid, he rejoined, that there may be, within the
tomb, robbers who slay men and steal their property; for when evening
overtaketh them they enter these places to divide what they have
taken.&mdash;O thou of little sense, exclaimed the two others; can they
enter here?&mdash;They then put down the chest, and climbed up the wall,
and descended, and opened the door, while the third slave, Bakheet,
stood waiting for them with the light, and a basket containing some
plaster: after which they seated themselves, having closed the door;
and one of them said, O my brother, we are tired with walking and
taking up and putting down, and opening the door and shutting it,
and it is now midnight, and we have not strength remaining to open
the tomb and to bury the chest; wherefore we will sit here three hours
to rest ourselves, and then rise and accomplish our business: but each
of us shall in the mean time tell his story, and relate all that hath
happened to him from beginning to end. So the first, who carried the
light, told his story; but it was of a nature unfit to be here repeated;<a href="#VII12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
after which, another of the slaves thus began.</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF THE SLAVE K&Aacute;FOOR.<a href="#VII13" class="fnanchor">13</a></h5>

<p>Know, O my brothers, that I was, at the commencement of my
career, a boy of eight years, and I used to tell one lie to the slave-merchants
every year, so that they fell out with each other in consequence,
and the slave-merchant my master, becoming impatient of me,
committed me to the broker, desiring him to cry, Who will buy this
slave with his fault? He was therefore asked, What is his fault?&mdash;and
answered, He telleth one lie every year. And a merchant
approached the broker, and said to him, How much have they bidden
for this slave with his fault? He answered, They have bidden six
hundred pieces of silver.&mdash;Then thou shalt have twenty for thyself,
replied the merchant. So the broker introduced him to the slave-merchant,
who received from him the money, and the broker conveyed
me to the dwelling of the merchant, and took his brokerage.</p>

<p>The merchant clad me in a dress suitable to my condition, and I
continued with him for the remainder of the year, until the new year
commenced with prosperity. It was a blessed year, plenteous in the
produce of the earth, and the merchants began to give entertainments,
every day one taking his turn to do so, until it was my master's turn
to give an entertainment in a garden within the city. So he went,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
and the other merchants also, and he took for them what they required
of food and other provisions, and they sat eating and drinking and
carousing till noon, when my master wanted something from the house,
and said, O slave, mount the mule, and go to the house, and bring,
from thy mistress, such a thing, and return quickly.</p>

<p>I obeyed, therefore, and went to the house; but when I approached
it, I shrieked out, and shed tears; whereupon the people of the quarter
assembled together, old and young; and my master's wife and
daughters, hearing my cry, opened the door, and asked me what was
the matter. I answered them, My master was sitting beneath an old
wall, he and his friends, and it fell upon them; and when I beheld
what happened to them, I mounted the mule, and came in haste to
inform you. And when his children and wife heard these words, they
shrieked, and tore their clothes, and slapped their faces, and the neighbours
came to them. Then my master's wife overturned the furniture
of the house, one thing upon another, and pulled down its shelves,
and broke its shutters and its windows, and smeared its walls with
mud and indigo, and said to me. Wo to thee, O K&aacute;foor! Come
hither and help me, and demolish these cupboards, and smash these
vessels and this China-ware.&mdash;So I went to her, and destroyed with
her the shelves of the house and all that was upon them, and its cupboards
and what they contained, and went about over the terraces and
through every place until I had laid waste the whole, crying all the
while, Oh my master! My mistress then went forth, with her face
uncovered, and only with her head-veil, and the girls and boys went
with her, saying to me, O K&aacute;foor, walk on before us, and shew us the
place where thy master lieth dead beneath the wall, that we may take
him forth from under the ruins, and carry him in a bier, and bring
him to the house, and convey his corpse in a handsome manner to the
burial. So I walked before them, crying, Oh my master!&mdash;and they
followed me with their faces and heads uncovered,<a href="#VII14" class="fnanchor">14</a> crying, Oh our
misfortune! Oh our calamity!&mdash;and there was none among the men,
nor among the women, nor among the children, nor a maiden, nor an
old woman, [in the quarter,] who did not accompany us; and all of
them slapped themselves in the excess of their lamentation. Thus I
went with them through the city; and the people asking the news,
they informed them of that which they had heard from me; and the
people exclaimed, There is no strength nor power but in God, the High,
the Great! We will go to the W&aacute;lee, and acquaint him.&mdash;And when
they arrived before the W&aacute;lee, they informed him; and he mounted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
and took with him labourers with axes and baskets, and they followed
my footsteps, accompanied by a crowd of people.</p>

<p>I preceded them, weeping and crying out, and throwing dust upon
my head, and slapping my face; and when I came to the party in the
garden, and my master beheld me, I slapped my face, and exclaimed,
Oh my mistress! who will have pity upon me after my mistress?
Would that I had been her sacrifice!&mdash;When my master, therefore,
saw me, he was confounded, his countenance became pale, and he said,
What aileth thee, O K&aacute;foor, and what is this predicament, and what
is the news? I answered him, When thou sentest me to the house to
bring thee what thou wantedst, I went thither and entered the house,
and found that the wall of the saloon had fallen, and that the whole
saloon had tumbled down upon my mistress and her children.&mdash;And
did not thy mistress, said he, escape? I answered, No: not one of
them escaped; and the first of them that died was my mistress the
elder.&mdash;But did my youngest daughter escape? he asked. I answered,
No.&mdash;And what, said he, hath become of the mule that I ride: is she
safe?&mdash;No, O my master, I answered: for the walls of the house and
the walls of the stable tumbled down upon all that was in the house;
even upon the sheep and the geese and the hens, and all of them
became a mass of flesh beneath the ruins; not one of them escaped.
He then said to me, And thy master the elder? I answered, No: not
one escaped; and now there remains neither house nor inhabitant, nor
any trace of them; and as to the sheep and the geese and the hens,
the cats and dogs have now eaten them.&mdash;And when my master heard
my words, the light became darkness before his face, and he was no
longer master of his senses nor of his reason, and was unable to stand
upon his feet: he was paralyzed, and the strength of his back failed
him, and he rent his clothes and plucked his beard and slapped his
face and threw his turban from his head, and ceased not to slap his
face until the blood flowed from it: and he began to cry, Ah! Oh my
children! Ah! Oh my wife! Ah! Oh my misfortune! Unto
whom hath happened the like of that which hath happened to me?&mdash;The
merchants, also, his companions, joined with him in cries and
lamentations, and were moved with pity for his case, and rent their
clothes; and my master went forth from the garden, beating himself
for the calamity that had [as he supposed] befallen him, and redoubled
the blows upon his face, seeming as though he were drunk.</p>

<p>And as the party thus went out from the gate of the garden, they
beheld a great dust, and heard tumultuous cries, and, looking in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
direction, saw the crowd approaching them. This crowd was the W&aacute;lee
and his attendants, and a concourse of people who had come to gratify
their curiosity, with the merchant's family behind them, shrieking and
crying with violent lamentation and excessive grief; and the first who
accosted my master were his wife and children. On beholding these,
he was confounded, and laughed, and said to them, How are ye; and
what hath happened to you in the house, and what hath befallen you?
And when they saw him, they exclaimed, Praise be to God for thy
safety! And they threw themselves upon him, and his children clung
to him, crying out, Oh our father! Praise be to God for thy safety,
O our father!&mdash;and his wife said to him, Praise be to God who hath
shewn us thy face in safety!&mdash;and she was stupified, and her reason fled
from her at that which she beheld. She then said to him, How didst
thou escape with thy friends?&mdash;And how, said he, were ye in the
house?&mdash;We were all well, they answered, in prosperity and health,
and no evil hath befallen our house, save that thy slave K&aacute;foor came
to us with his head uncovered and his clothes rent, crying out, Oh my
master! Oh my master!&mdash;and we said to him, What is the matter,
O K&aacute;foor?&mdash;and he answered, My master was sitting under a wall
in the garden, and it fell upon him, and he died.&mdash;By Allah, replied
my master, he came to me just now, crying, Oh my mistress! Oh the
children of my mistress!&mdash;and said, My mistress and her children are
all dead!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 578px; position: relative;"><a name="f170" id="f170"></a><img src="images/fig170.png" width="578" height="302" alt="The Merchant meeting his Family" title="The Merchant meeting his Family" /></div>

<p>He then looked aside, and, seeing me with my turban falling from
my head, while I still cried out and wept violently and threw dust
upon my head, he called out to me: so I approached him, and he said
to me, Wo to thee! O malevolent slave! O misbegotten wretch! O
thou of accursed race! What events hast thou brought about! But,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
by Allah, I will strip off thy skin from thy flesh, and cut thy flesh
from thy bones!&mdash;By Allah, replied I, thou canst not do to me anything;
for thou boughtest me with my fault, on this condition, the
witnesses testifying that thou boughtest me with my fault, thou knowing
it, and it was, that I was accustomed to tell one lie every year;
and this is but half a lie, and when the year is complete I will tell the
other half of it; so it will be an entire lie. But upon this, he cried
out at me, O most accursed of slaves! is this but half a lie? Nay, it
is an exceeding calamity! Depart from me; for thou art free!<a href="#VII15" class="fnanchor">15</a>&mdash;By
Allah, I replied, if thou liberate me, I will not liberate thee until the
year be complete, and I tell the remaining half of the lie; and when I
have completed it, then take me to the market, and sell me as thou
boughtest me with my fault, and liberate me not; for I have no trade
by means of which to procure my subsistence: this is a legal proposition
that I have stated to thee, laid down by the lawyers in the
Chapter of Emancipation.<a href="#VII16" class="fnanchor">16</a>&mdash;While we were thus talking, the crowd
approached, with the people of the quarter, women and men, come to
mourn, and the W&aacute;lee with his attendants: and my master and the
other merchants went to the W&aacute;lee, and acquainted him with the case,
and that this was but half a lie; and when the people who were
present heard this, they were astonished at this lie, and struck with
the utmost wonder; and they cursed and reviled me; while I stood
laughing, and saying, How can my master kill me when he bought
me with this fault?</p>

<p>So when my master went to the house, he found it in a state of
ruin (and it was I who destroyed the greater part, and broke in it
things worth a large sum of money); and his wife said to him, It was
K&aacute;foor who broke the vessels and the China-ware. Upon this, his
rage increased, and he exclaimed, By Allah! in my life I have never
seen such a misbegotten wretch as this slave; yet he calleth it half a
lie! What then would have been the result had it been a whole lie!
In that case he had destroyed a city, or two cities!&mdash;Then, in the
excess of his rage, he went to the W&aacute;lee, who inflicted upon me a
severe beating, so that I became insensible, and swooned away; after
which, my master contrived means of obtaining for me a high price,
and I ceased not to excite disturbances in the places into which I was
sold, and was transferred from Emeer to Emeer and from Grandee to
Grandee, by sale and purchase, until I entered the palace of the Prince
of the Faithful, and now my spirit is broken, and my strength hath
failed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span></p>

<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF GH&Aacute;NIM THE SON OF EIYOOB,
THE DISTRACTED SLAVE OF LOVE.</h5>

<p>When the other slaves had heard his story, they laughed at it, and
said to him, Verily thou art a villain, the son of a villain: thou hast
told an abominable lie. The first and second then said to the third
slave, Relate to us thy story.&mdash;O sons of my uncle, he replied, all
that hath just been related is nonsense: but my story is long, and this
is not a time to tell it; for the morning, O sons of my uncle, is near,
and perhaps it may overtake us with this chest still before us, and we
shall be disgraced among the public, and our lives will be lost; haste
then to work, and when we have finished, and returned home, I will
relate to you my story. So they put down the light, and dug a
trench of the size of the chest between four tombs; K&aacute;foor digging,
and &#7778;aw&aacute;b removing the earth in baskets, until they had dug to the
depth of half a fathom, when they put the chest into the trench, and
replaced the earth over it, and went forth from the enclosure, and,
having closed the gate, disappeared from before the eyes of Gh&aacute;nim
the son of Eiyoob.</p>

<p>When, therefore, they had left the place vacant unto Gh&aacute;nim, and
he knew that he was alone, his mind became busied respecting the
contents of the chest, and he said within himself, What can this chest
contain? He waited until daybreak gleamed and shone forth, and
then descended from the palm-tree, and removed the earth with his
hand until he had uncovered the chest and disengaged it, when he
took a stone, and struck with it the lock, and broke it; and lifting up
the cover, he looked in, and beheld a sleeping damsel, stupified with
benj,<a href="#VII17" class="fnanchor">17</a> but still breathing: she was of beautiful and lovely person,
and decked with ornaments of gold, and necklaces of jewels, worth a
kingdom, and of a value that no money would equal. When Gh&aacute;nim
the son of Eiyoob beheld her, he knew that she had been the object of
a plot, and, being convinced of this, he pulled her up until he had
lifted her out of the chest, and laid her upon her back; and as soon as
she scented the breeze, and the air entered her nostrils and her mouth
and throat, she sneezed, and then was choked, and coughed, whereupon
there fell from her throat a round piece of benj, of such potency
that if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from one night to another.
She then opened her eyes, and, looking round, said, with an eloquent
voice, Wo to thee, O wind! Thou neither satisfiest the thirsty, nor
cheerest by thy presence the satisfied with drink! Where is Zahr-el-Bust&aacute;n?&mdash;But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
no one answered her. Then looking aside, she
exclaimed, &#7778;abee&#7717;ah! Shejeret-ed-Durr! Noor-el-Hud&agrave;! Nejmet-e&#7779;-&#7778;ub&#7717;!
Art thou awake?<a href="#VII18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Nuzheh! &#7716;ulweh! &#7826;areefeh! Speak
ye!&mdash;But no one answered her. And she looked round about her,
and exclaimed, Alas for me, that I am transported to the tombs! O
Thou who knowest the secrets of the breasts, and recompensest on the
day of resurrection! who hath brought me from among the curtains
and the veils, and placed me amid four tombs?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 483px; position: relative;"><a name="f171" id="f171"></a><img src="images/fig171.png" width="483" height="509" alt="Koot-el-Kuloob awaking" title="Koot-el-Kuloob awaking" /></div>

<p>While she was saying all this, Gh&aacute;nim stood still; but he now
said to her, O my mistress, there are neither veils nor palaces nor
tombs for thee here: this is none other than thy slave Gh&aacute;nim the son
of Eiyoob, whom the King who is omniscient with respect to hidden
things hath impelled hither that he may deliver thee from these
troubles, and that the utmost of thy desires may be accomplished unto
thee.&mdash;And he was silent; and when she became convinced of the
truth of the case, she exclaimed, I testify that there is no deity but
God, and I testify that Mo&#7717;ammad is God's Apostle! Then looking
towards Gh&aacute;nim, with her hands placed upon her breast, she said to
him, with a sweet voice, O auspicious youth, who brought me unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
this place? For now I have recovered my senses.&mdash;O my mistress, he
answered, three eunuchs came bearing this chest:&mdash;and he related to
her all that had happened, and how the evening had overtaken him, so
that he became the means of her preservation, and that otherwise she
had died of suffocation; and he inquired of her respecting her history.&mdash;O
youth, she replied, praise be to God who hath cast me into the
hands of one like thee! Rise therefore now, and put me into the
chest, and go forth to the road, and as soon as thou shalt find any one
who lets out asses or other beasts, or a muleteer, hire him to transport
this chest, and convey me to thy house; and when I am in thy abode
it will be well, and I will relate to thee my story, and acquaint thee
with my tale, and good fortune will accrue to thee through my means.&mdash;So
Gh&aacute;nim rejoiced, and he went forth into the desert tract.</p>

<p>The day had begun to gleam, the sun rose in splendour, and the
people come walking forth; and Gh&aacute;nim hired a man with a mule,
and brought him to the burial-place. He then lifted the chest, after
he had put the damsel into it, and, with his heart smitten by love for
her, proceeded with her, full of joy, for she was a damsel worth ten
thousand pieces of gold, and was decked with ornaments and apparel
of enormous value. Scarcely had he found himself at his house when
he put down the chest, and opened it, and took forth from it the
damsel, who looked, and saw that the place was a handsome dwelling
furnished with variegated carpets, and she observed the gay colours
and various embellishments, and beheld stuffs packed up, and loads of
goods, and other property: so she knew that he was a great merchant,
and a man of wealth. She then uncovered her face, and looked at
him, and observed him to be a handsome young man, and loved him;
and she said to him, Bring us something to eat. He answered her,
On the head and the eye be thy commands:&mdash;and went to the market,
and bought a roasted lamb, and a dish of sweetmeat, and procured
some dried fruits, and candles and wine, and the requisite apparatus
for perfumes. Then returning to the house, he took in the things,
and when the damsel saw him, she laughed, and kissed him, and
embraced him, and began to caress him, so that the love which he felt
increased, and took entire possession of his heart. They then ate and
drank until the approach of night, and their love was mutual: for they
were both of the same age, and both equal in comeliness; and when
the night approached, the Distracted Slave of Love, Gh&aacute;nim the son
of Eiyoob, rose and lighted the candles and lamps, and the chamber
glistened: he then brought forth the wine-service, and prepared the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
table, and sat down with her; he filling and handing to her, and she
filling and handing to him, while they both toyed and laughed and
recited verses: their gaiety increased, and they were engrossed by
mutual love.&mdash;Extolled be the perfection of the Uniter of Hearts!&mdash;
Thus they continued until it was near morning, when sleep overcame
them, and each of them slept apart from the other till morning came.</p>

<p>Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob then arose, and went forth to the
market, and bought what was requisite of vegetables and meat and
wine and other provisions, and brought them to the house; and he
again sat with her to eat, and they ate until they were satisfied; after
which he brought the wine, and they drank and toyed together till
their cheeks reddened and their eyes became more intensely black;<a href="#VII19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
and Gh&aacute;nim said, O my mistress, have compassion on the captive of
thy love, and him whom thine eyes have slain. I had remained sound
of heart but for thee.&mdash;Then he wept a while; and she replied, O my
master, and light of mine eye, By Allah, I love thee and confide in
thee; but I know that thou canst not be united to me.&mdash;And what
hindereth? said he. She answered, I will this night relate to thee
my story, that thou mayest accept my excuse. But they continued
thus a whole month; and after this, one night, when Gh&aacute;nim was
complaining to her of his passion, she said to him, I will now explain
to thee my case, that thou mayest know my dignity, and that my
secret may be revealed to thee, and my excuse become manifest to thee.
He replied, Well. And she took hold of a band which confined a part
of her dress, and said to him, O my master, read what is on this
border. So he took the border in his hand, and looked at it, and
found worked upon it in gold, I am thine, and thou art mine, O
descendant of the Prophet's Uncle.<a href="#VII20" class="fnanchor">20</a> And when he had read this, he
let fall his hand, and said to her, Reveal to me thy history. She
answered, Well:&mdash;and thus began:&mdash;</p>

<p>Know that I am a favourite slave of the Prince of the Faithful,
and my name is &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob.<a href="#VII21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The Prince of the Faithful, after
he had reared me in his palace, and I had grown up, observed my
qualities, and the beauty and loveliness with which my Lord had
endowed me, and loved me excessively: he took me and lodged me in
a private apartment, and appointed me ten female slaves to serve me,
and then gave me those ornaments which thou seest with me. After
this, the Khaleefeh went forth one day on a journey to one of the
surrounding provinces, and the lady Zubeydeh came to one of the
female slaves who were in my service, and said, When thy mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
&#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob sleepeth, put this piece of benj into her nose and her
drink, and thou shalt receive from me a sum of money that will satisfy
thee. The slave replied, Most willingly:&mdash;and she received the benj
from her, rejoicing on account of the money, and because she had been
originally Zubeydeh's slave; and she insinuated the benj into me,
whereupon I fell upon the floor, with my head bent down to my feet,
and seemed to be in another world. And when she could devise no
other stratagem, she put me into that chest, and privily summoned the
black slaves, and, after having given presents to them and to the door-keepers,
sent me with the black slaves on the night when thou wast
reposing at the top of the palm-tree: and they did with me as thou
sawest, and my deliverance was effected through thy means. Then
thou broughtest me unto this place, where thou hast treated me with
the utmost kindness. This is my story; and I know not what hath
happened to the Khaleefeh during my absence. Know, therefore, my
dignity; and divulge not my case.</p>

<p>When Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob heard these words of &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob,
and discovered that she was the favourite of the Khaleefeh, he
drew back, in his awe of the Khaleefeh, and sat alone at one side of
the chamber, blaming himself, and reflecting upon his situation, perplexed
by love of her to whom he could not be united; and he wept
from the violence of his desire, and the fierceness of his passion and
distraction, and began to complain of fortune and its injustice.&mdash;Extolled
be the perfection of Him who causeth the hearts of the
generous to be troubled with love, and endueth not the mean with so
much of it as equalleth the weight of a grain!&mdash;And upon this, &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob
rose to him, and embraced and kissed him, and, her heart
being entirely captivated by his love, she revealed what she had hidden
of the extent of her passion, and encircled his neck with her arms,
and kissed him again; but he withdrew from her embrace, in his fear
of the Khaleefeh. They then conversed a while, drowned in the sea
of mutual love, and so remained until day, when Gh&aacute;nim arose, and
went forth to the market as usual, and procured what was requisite,
and, returning to the house, found &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob weeping: but as
soon as she beheld him, she ceased from her tears, and smiled, and
said to him, Thou hast made me desolate by thine absence, O beloved
of my heart! By Allah, this hour during which thou hast been away
from me hath appeared as a year; for I cannot endure thy separation;
and see, I have thus shewn thee my state, through the violence of my
passion. Arise therefore now, and mind not what hath happened, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
take me as thy wife.&mdash;But he replied, I seek refuge with Allah! This
is a thing that cannot be. How should the dog sit in the place of the
lion? What belongeth to my lord is forbidden me to approach.&mdash;He
then tore himself from her, and sat apart; and she increased in love
through his refusal.&mdash;In this manner they passed three long months;
and whenever she made any advances to him he withdrew from her,
and said, Whatever belongeth to the master is forbidden to the slave.&mdash;Such
was the case of the Distracted Slave of Love, Gh&aacute;nim the son
of Eiyoob.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Zubeydeh, during the absence of the Khaleefeh, having
acted thus with &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, became perplexed, saying within herself,
What shall I say to the Khaleefeh when he cometh and inquireth
respecting her; and what shall be my answer to him? She then
called for an old woman who resided with her, and acquainted her
with her secret, and said to her, What shall I do, now that &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob
is no more? The old woman answered, when she understood
the affair, Know, O my mistress, that the return of the Khaleefeh is
near; but I will send to a carpenter, and desire him to make a wooden
image of a corpse, and they shall dig for it a grave, and thou shalt
light candles and lamps around it, and command every one who is in
the palace to wear black,<a href="#VII22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and order thy female slaves and eunuchs, as
soon as they know of the Khaleefeh's return from his journey, to raise
lamentations in the vestibules, and when he enters and asks the news,
they shall answer him, &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob is dead; and may God abundantly
compensate thee for the loss of her!&mdash;and from the esteem with
which she was regarded by our mistress, she hath buried her in her own
palace. So when he heareth this, he will weep, and the event will distress
him. Then he will cause the readers to sit up by night at her tomb
to perform recitations of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n: and if he say within himself,
Surely the daughter of my uncle, through her jealousy, hath been led
to destroy &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob,&mdash;or the distraction of love overpower him,
and he give orders to take her forth from the tomb, fear not from that;
for if they dig down to the image in the form of a human being, and
take it forth, shrouded in costly grave-clothes, and the Khaleefeh
desire to remove the grave-clothes from it, to behold her, do thou prevent
him, and the fear of the world to come will withhold him; and
do thou say to him, To behold her corpse uncovered is unlawful.
Then he will believe her death, and will return her image to its place,
and thank thee for thy conduct, and thou shalt escape, if it please
God, from this difficulty.&mdash;When the lady Zubeydeh, therefore, heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
what she said, she approved it, and bestowed upon her a dress of
honour, and commanded her to do this, having given her a sum of
money. So the old woman set about the business immediately, and
ordered the carpenter to make for her an image as above described;
and when it was finished, she brought it to the lady Zubeydeh, and
she shrouded it, and lighted the candles and lamps, and spread the
carpets around the tomb, and clad herself in black, ordering the female
slaves to do the same; and the news was spread through the palace,
that &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob had died.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 538px; position: relative;"><a name="f172" id="f172"></a><img src="images/fig172.png" width="538" height="613" alt="Pretended Tomb of Koot-el-Kuloob" title="Pretended Tomb of Koot-el-Kuloob" /></div>

<p>Some time after this, the Khaleefeh returned from his journey,
and went up to his palace; but his mind was occupied only with
&#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob; and seeing the pages and eunuchs and female slaves
all clad in black, his heart was agitated; and when he entered the
palace of the lady Zubeydeh, and beheld her also clad in black, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
inquired the reason of it, and they informed him of the death of &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob.
Upon hearing this, he fell down in a swoon; and when
he recovered, he asked where was her tomb; and the lady Zubeydeh
answered, Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that, on account of the
esteem in which she was held by me, I buried her in my palace. So
the Khaleefeh, entering the palace in his travelling-dress, proceeded to
visit the tomb of &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, and found the carpets spread, and
the candles and lamps lighted; and when he beheld this, he thanked
her for what she had done. But afterwards he became perplexed, and
wavered a while between belief and disbelief, until suspicion overcame
him, and he gave orders to open the tomb and to take her out: when,
however, he saw the grave-clothes, and was about to remove them that
he might behold her, he feared God (whose name be exalted!), and
the old woman said, Restore her to her place. Then immediately the
Khaleefeh commanded to bring the professors of religion and law, and
the readers, and they performed recitations of the whole of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n
at her tomb, while he sat by the side of it weeping until he became
insensible.</p>

<p>He continued to frequent the tomb for the space of a month; after
which it happened that he entered the &#7716;areem, after the emeers and
wezeers had dispersed from before him to their houses, and he slept a
while, and a female slave sat at his head, and another at his feet; and
after sleep had overcome him he awoke, and opened his eyes, and
heard the damsel who was at his head say to her who was at his feet,
Wo to thee, O Kheyzur&aacute;n!&mdash;Wherefore, O &#7730;a&#7693;eeb?<a href="#VII23" class="fnanchor">23</a> said the other.&mdash;Our
lord, rejoined the first, is ignorant of what hath happened; so
he sitteth up by night at a tomb in which there is nothing but a carved
image, the work of the carpenter.&mdash;And what then, asked the other
damsel, hath befallen &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob? Her companion answered,
Know that our mistress Zubeydeh sent some benj by a female slave,
and she stupified her with it, and when the benj had taken effect upon
her, she put her in a chest, and sent her away with &#7778;aw&aacute;b and K&aacute;foor,
commanding them to throw her into the tomb. Upon this, Kheyzur&aacute;n
said, Wo to thee, O &#7730;a&#7693;eeb! Is not the lady &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob dead?&mdash;Heaven
preserve her youth from death! answered &#7730;a&#7693;eeb: I heard
the lady Zubeydeh say that &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob was with a young
merchant named Gh&aacute;nim of Damascus, and that she had been with
him, including this day, four months; and our lord here weepeth and
passeth sleepless nights at a tomb in which there is no corpse.&mdash;Thus
they conversed together, while the Khaleefeh heard their words; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
when they had finished their conversation, and he had become
acquainted with the event, that this tomb was a false one, and that
&#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob had been with Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob for the space
of four months, he was violently incensed, and arose, and summoned
the emeers of his court; whereupon the Wezeer Ja&#7841;far El-Barmekee
presented himself and kissed the ground before him, and the Khaleefeh
said to him, in anger, Descend, O Ja&#7841;far, with a body of men, and
inquire for the house of Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob, and assault it
suddenly, and bring him hither with my female slave &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob;
and I will assuredly torture him.</p>

<p>Ja&#7841;far replied, I hear and obey;&mdash;and he went forth with his
attendants, the W&aacute;lee also accompanying him, and they proceeded
until they arrived at Gh&aacute;nim's house. Gh&aacute;nim had just before gone
out and brought a pot of meat, and was about to stretch forth his
hand to eat of it with &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, when she looked out, and found
that the house was beset on all sides, and the Wezeer and the W&aacute;lee
and the officers of violence and the memlooks with drawn swords were
surrounding it as the black surrounds the pupil of the eye; and upon
this she knew that tidings of her situation had reached the ears of the
Khaleefeh her lord, and she made sure of destruction; her countenance
became pale, and her beauty changed, and, looking towards Gh&aacute;nim,
she said to him, O my beloved, save thyself!&mdash;How shall I do, said he,
and whither shall I flee, when my wealth and means of subsistence are
in this house? But she answered, Delay not, lest thou perish, and
thy wealth also be lost.&mdash;O my mistress, and light of mine eye,
rejoined he, how can I contrive to go forth when they are surrounding
the house?&mdash;Fear not, she answered:&mdash;and she pulled off his clothes,
and clad him in worn-out, ragged garments, and, taking the pot that
had contained the meat, placed it upon his head, and put in it a little
bread and a saucer of meat, and said to him, Go forth by the help of
this stratagem, and thou hast nothing to fear with respect to me, for I
know what I am able to do with the Khaleefeh. When Gh&aacute;nim,
therefore, heard the words of &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, and the advice which
she gave him, he went forth through the midst of them, bearing the
pot, and Providence protected him so that he escaped from the snares
and injuries which menaced him, by the blessing of his good conscience.</p>

<p>And when the Wezeer Ja&#7841;far arrived at the house, he dismounted
from his horse, and entered, and looked at &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, who had
adorned herself, and filled a chest with gold and ornaments and jewels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
and rarities, such as were light to carry and of great value; and when
Ja&#7841;far came in to her, she rose upon her feet, and kissed the ground
before him, saying to him, O my master, the Pen hath written what
God hath decreed.<a href="#VII24" class="fnanchor">24</a> But Ja&#7841;far, when he beheld her situation, replied,
By Allah, O my mistress, he gave me no order but to arrest Gh&aacute;nim
the son of Eiyoob. And she said, Know that he hath packed up some
bales of merchandise, and gone with them to Damascus, and I know
nothing more than this; and I request thee to take care of this chest
for me, and to convey it to the palace of the Prince of the Faithful.
So Ja&#7841;far answered, I hear and obey:&mdash;and he took the chest, and
gave orders that it should be conveyed, together with &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob,
to the palace of the Khaleefeh, treating her with honour and respect.
This took place after they had plundered the house of Gh&aacute;nim; and
they went to the Khaleefeh, and Ja&#7841;far related to him all that had
happened; whereupon the Khaleefeh appointed to &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob a
dark chamber, and there lodged her, commissioning an old woman to
serve her; for he imagined that Gh&aacute;nim had acted dishonestly towards
her.</p>

<p>He then wrote a letter to the Emeer Mo&#7717;ammad the son of Suleym&aacute;n
Ez-Zeynee, who was viceroy of Damascus, containing as follows:&mdash;As
soon as this letter cometh to thy hands, thou shalt arrest Gh&aacute;nim
the son of Eiyoob, and send him unto me.&mdash;So when the mandate was
brought to him, he kissed it, and put it upon his head, and caused it
to be proclaimed through the market-street, Whosoever desireth to
plunder, let him repair to the house of Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob.
And they came to the house, and found that the mother of Gh&aacute;nim,
and his sister, had made for them a tomb, and sat by it weeping; and
they laid hold upon them, and plundered the house, and the mother
and sister knew not the cause: and when they brought them before
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n,<a href="#VII25" class="fnanchor">25</a> he inquired of them respecting Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob;
and they answered him, For the space of a year we have obtained no
tidings of him.&mdash;And they restored them to their place.<a href="#VII26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px; position: relative;"><a name="f173" id="f173"></a><img src="images/fig173.png" width="486" height="601" alt="Gh&aacute;nim sick in a Mosque" title="Gh&aacute;nim sick in a Mosque" /></div>

<p>In the mean time, Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob, the Distracted
Slave of Love, when his wealth had been seized, was perplexed, and
began to weep for himself so as to break his heart. He walked on,
and ceased not on his way to the close of day, suffering from excessive
hunger and fatigue, until he arrived at a village, where he entered a
mosque, and seated himself upon a round mat,<a href="#VII27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and he leaned his
back against one of the walls of the building, and then threw himself
down, under the influence of extreme hunger and weariness. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
he remained until the morning, his heart palpitating from want of
food; vermin attacked his body, his breath became fetid, and he was
altogether changed; and the people of that village, coming to perform
the morning-prayers, found him lying there sick through want of food,
yet exhibiting evident traces of former affluence; and when they
approached him, they found him cold and hungry. They clad him,
therefore, with an old garment having ragged sleeves, and said to him,
Whence art thou, O stranger, and what is the cause of thine infirmity?
And Gh&aacute;nim opened his eyes and looked at them and wept; but he
returned them no answer. Then one of them, knowing the violence
of his hunger, went and brought him a saucer of honey and two cakes
of bread, and he ate, while they sat around him until the sun rose,
when they departed to their several occupations.&mdash;In this state he
remained among them for a month, and his infirmity and disease
increased; so the people, commiserating him, consulted together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
respecting his case, and agreed to transport him to the hospital at
Baghd&aacute;d.</p>

<p>Now while they were thus conversing, lo, two women, beggars,
came in to him; and they were his mother and sister; and when he
beheld them, he gave them the bread that was at his head, and they
slept by him the next night; but he knew them not. And on the
following day, the people of the village came to him, bringing a camel,
and said to its owner, Convey this sick person on the camel, and
when thou hast arrived at Baghd&aacute;d, put him down at the door of
the hospital: perhaps he may recover his health, and thou wilt receive
a recompense. He answered them, I hear and obey. So they
brought forth Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob from the mosque, and placed
him, with the round mat upon which he was sleeping, on the camel;
and his mother and sister came to look at him among the other
people; but they knew him not. Then observing him attentively,
they said, Verily he resembleth our Gh&aacute;nim! Can he be this sick
person or not?&mdash;But as to Gh&aacute;nim, he awoke not until he was
mounted on the camel, and he began to weep and moan; and the
people of the village saw his mother and sister weeping for him, though
they did not know him. Then his mother and sister journeyed onwards
to Baghd&aacute;d, while the camel-driver also proceeded without stopping
until he had deposited Gh&aacute;nim at the door of the hospital, when he took
his camel, and returned.</p>

<p>Gh&aacute;nim remained lying there until the morning; and when the
people began to pass along the street, they beheld him. He had
become so emaciated that his form resembled that of a toothpick,
and the people ceased not to gaze at him until the Sheykh of the
market came and repelled them from him, and said, I will gain
Paradise by means of this poor person; for if they take him into the
hospital they will kill him in one day. He then ordered his young
men to carry him, and they conveyed him to his house, where he spread
for him a new bed, and put for him a new cushion, and said to his
wife, Serve him faithfully. She replied, On the head:&mdash;and she tucked
up her sleeves, and, having heated for him some water, washed his
hands and feet and body, and clothed him in a vest of one of her
female slaves. She then gave him to drink a cup of wine, and
sprinkled rose-water upon him: so he recovered his senses; and he
remembered his beloved, &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, and his anguish increased.&mdash;Thus
did it happen to Gh&aacute;nim.</p>

<p>Now as to &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob,&mdash;when the Khaleefeh, incensed against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
her, had lodged her in the dark chamber, she remained there in the
same state for eighty days; and it happened that the Khaleefeh passed
one day by that place, and heard her reciting verses; and when she
had finished her recitation of them, she exclaimed, O my beloved! O
Gh&aacute;nim! How kind art thou, and how chaste is thy disposition!
Thou hast acted with kindness unto him who hath injured thee, and
hast guarded the honour of him who hath violated thine, and hast protected
his &#7717;areem and he hath enslaved both thee and thy family; but
thou wilt assuredly stand, with the Prince of the Faithful, before a
Just Judge, and thou wilt obtain justice against him on the day when
the judge shall be God; and the witnesses, the angels!&mdash;And when
the Khaleefeh heard her words, and understood her complaint, he
knew that she was injured; and he entered his palace, and sent the
eunuch to her, and when she came before him she hung down her
head, with weeping eye, and sorrowful heart; and he said to her, O
&#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, I see that thou complainest of my oppression, and
accusest me of tyranny, and thinkest that I have injured him who hath
acted kindly unto me. Who then is he who hath guarded my honour
and I have violated his; and who hath protected my &#7717;areem and I
have enslaved his?<a href="#VII28" class="fnanchor">28</a>&mdash;She answered him, Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob;
for he hath not attempted any dishonest action towards me, by thy
beneficence, O Prince of the Faithful!&mdash;Upon this the Khaleefeh
exclaimed, There is no strength nor power but in God!&mdash;and then
added, O &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, desire of me what thou wilt, and I will
grant thy wish. So she replied, I desire of thee my beloved, Gh&aacute;nim
the son of Eiyoob. And when he heard her words, he said, I will
cause him to be brought hither, if it be the will of God, in honour.&mdash;O
Prince of the Faithful, she rejoined, when thou shalt have caused
him to be brought, wilt thou present me to him? He answered,
When I have had him brought, I will present thee to him, the present
of a generous man who will not revoke his gift. So she said, O Prince
of the Faithful, permit me to search about for him: perhaps God may
unite me with him. And he replied, Do as thou wilt.</p>

<p>Upon this she rejoiced, and went forth, taking with her a thousand
pieces of gold and visited the sheykhs, and gave alms for the sake of
Gh&aacute;nim:<a href="#VII29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and on the following day she went to the market of the
merchants, and gave to the chief of the market some money, saying to
him, Bestow it in alms upon the strangers. Then again, in the
following week, she went forth, taking with her a thousand pieces of
gold, and, entering the market of the goldsmiths and jewellers, sum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>moned
the chief of the market, and he came, and she gave him the
thousand pieces of gold, and said to him, Bestow it in alms upon the
strangers: whereupon the chief, who was the Sheykh of the market
before mentioned, looked at her, and said to her, Wilt thou go with
me to my house, to look at a young stranger there, and see how
elegant he is, and how perfectly charming? For it is probable that
he is Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob, the Distracted Slave of Love.&mdash;But
the chief had no knowledge of him, and imagined that he was a poor
person involved in debt, whose wealth had been taken from him, or a
lover parted from his beloved. And when she heard his words, her
heart beat, and her affections were engrossed by him, and she answered,
Send with me some one to conduct me to thy house. So he sent with
her a young boy, who conducted her to the house where the stranger
was lodged, and she thanked him for doing so; and when she entered
the house, and saluted the chief's wife, the latter arose, and kissed the
ground before her; for she knew her. Then &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob said to
her, Where is the sick person who is with you? And she wept, and
answered, Here he is, O my mistress: but he is of a respectable family,
and exhibiteth traces of former affluence. And &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob looked
towards the bed upon which he was lying, and, regarding him
narrowly, beheld him as though he were Gh&aacute;nim himself; but his
condition was changed, and he had become so emaciated that he
resembled a toothpick, and the truth of his case was disguised from
her, so that she did not discover him to be the person whom she
sought; but she was moved with compassion for him, and she wept,
and exclaimed, Verily, strangers are objects of pity, though they be
emeers in their own countries! She then ordered for him supplies of
wine and medicines, and sat at his head a while, and mounted, and
returned to her palace; and she continued to go forth to every market
for the purpose of searching for Gh&aacute;nim.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px; position: relative;"><a name="f174" id="f174"></a><img src="images/fig174.png" width="411" height="501" alt="Gh&aacute;nim's Mother and Sister as Beggars" title="Gh&aacute;nim's Mother and Sister as Beggars" /></div>

<p>Soon after, the chief of the market brought the mother of Gh&aacute;nim,
and his sister Fitneh, and went with them to &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, and
said to her, O most charitable lady, there have entered our city this
day a woman and a girl of respectable origin, bearing evident traces of
former affluence, but they are clad in garments of hair-cloth, and each
of them hath a wallet hung to her neck, and their eyes are weeping,
and their hearts sorrowful: so I have brought them unto thee, that
thou mayest give them refuge, and preserve them from the disgrace of
beggary; for they are not persons suited to ask alms of the sordid;
and if it please God, we shall enter Paradise by their means.&mdash;By<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Allah, O my master, she replied, thou hast made me long to behold
them! Where are they? Order them to come in.&mdash;So, upon this,
Fitneh and her mother came in to &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, who, when she saw
them, and observed that they were both distinguished by beauty, wept
for them, and said, By Allah, they are persons of an affluent family,
and traces of wealth are conspicuous in their appearance.&mdash;O my
mistress, replied the chief of the market, we love the poor and indigent
for the sake of future recompense;<a href="#VII30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and probably the extortioners
have oppressed these two persons, and plundered them of their wealth,
and ruined their houses. Then these two females wept violently, and,
remembering Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob, the Distracted Slave of Love,
their wailing increased, and &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob wept with them; and the
mother of Gh&aacute;nim exclaimed, We pray God to unite us with him whom
we seek, and he is my son Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob. When &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob,
therefore, heard these words, she knew that this woman
was the mother of her beloved, and that the other was his sister, and
she wept until she fell down in a swoon; and when she recovered, she
approached them, and said to them, Ye have nothing to fear; for this
day is the first of your prosperity, and the last of your adversity:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
therefore grieve not. She then ordered the chief of the market to
take them to his house, and to let his wife conduct them into the
bath, and attire them in handsome clothing, and take care of them,
and treat them with the utmost honour; and she gave him a sum of
money.</p>

<p>Then, on the following day, &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob mounted and went
again to the house of the chief of the market, and went in to visit his
wife, who rose to her, and kissed the ground before her, and thanked
her for her charity; and she saw that his wife had conducted the
mother of Gh&aacute;nim, and his sister, to the bath, and taken off their
former clothes, and that the traces of their original affluence had
become more conspicuous in consequence; and she sat a while conversing
with them; after which she asked the wife of the chief of the
market respecting the sick person who was with her. She answered,
He is in the same state. And &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob said, Arise, and let us
look at him and visit him. So they both arose, with Gh&aacute;nim's mother
and sister, and went in to him, and seated themselves by him; and
when Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob, the Distracted Slave of Love, heard
one of them mention &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, emaciated as he was in body
and limbs, his soul returned to him, and he raised his head from the
pillow, and called out, O &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob! She looked at him, therefore,
and knew him, and cried, saying, Yes, O my beloved! He then
said to her, Draw near to me. And she asked him, Art thou Gh&aacute;nim
the son of Eiyoob, the Distracted Slave of Love? He answered her,
Yes: I am he. And upon this, she fell down in a swoon; and when
his sister and his mother heard their words, they cried out, Oh, our
joy!&mdash;and in like manner fainted. And when they recovered, &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob
said to Gh&aacute;nim, Praise be to God who hath united us with
thee and with thy mother and sister! Then, approaching him, she
related to him all that had happened to her with the Khaleefeh,
adding, I said to him, I have declared to thee the truth, O Prince of
the Faithful:&mdash;and he believed my words, and approved thee; and he
is now desiring to see thee. And she said to him, The Khaleefeh
hath given me to thee:&mdash;whereupon he was filled with the utmost joy:
and &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob said to them all, Quit not this place until I come
again.</p>

<p>She then arose immediately, and departed to her palace, and
removed thence the chest that she had brought from Gh&aacute;nim's house,
and took forth from it some pieces of gold, which she gave to the
chief of the market, saying to him, Take these pieces of gold, and buy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
for each of them four complete suits of dress of the best kinds of stuff,
and twenty handkerchiefs, and whatever else they require. And after
this, she conducted them to the bath, and gave orders to wash them,
and prepared for them boiled meats, and infusion of galangal, and
apple-water, after they had come forth from the bath and dressed
themselves. For three days she remained with them, feeding them
with fowls and with boiled meats, and giving them sherbet of refined
sugar to drink; and after the three days their spirits returned to them.
Then she conducted them again to the bath, and they came forth,
and she changed their clothes, and, leaving them in the house of the
chief of the market, went to the Khaleefeh, and kissed the ground
before him, and related to him the story, telling him that her master,
Gh&aacute;nim the son of Eiyoob, the Distracted Slave of Love, had come,
and that his mother and sister also had arrived. When the Khaleefeh,
therefore, heard these words of &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob, he said to the eunuchs,
Bring hither to me Gh&aacute;nim. And Ja&#7841;far went down with them to
bring him: but &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob had gone before him; and she went
in unto Gh&aacute;nim, and said to him, The Khaleefeh hath sent to thee to
bring thee before him: have a care then to display eloquence of tongue,
and firmness of heart, and sweetness of speech. And she attired him
in a magnificent dress, and gave him pieces of gold in abundance,
saying to him, Bestow plentifully upon the domestics of the Khaleefeh
as thou goest in to him. And lo, Ja&#7841;far approached him, mounted
upon his mule, and Gh&aacute;nim advanced to meet him, and greeted him
with a prayer for long life, kissing the ground before him.</p>

<p>The planet of his prosperity had appeared, and the star of his
glory had risen aloft, and Ja&#7841;far took him, and they proceeded until
they entered into the presence of the Prince of the Faithful; and
when Gh&aacute;nim came before him, he looked towards the wezeers and
emeers and chamberlains and lieutenants and the other officers of
the court, and the warriours, and, being eloquent of tongue, firm of
heart, delicate in the style of his language, and pleasing in the allusions
it conveyed, he hung down his head towards the ground, and then looked
towards the Khaleefeh, and addressed him in a series of complimentary
verses. And when he had finished his recitation, the Khaleefeh was
delighted with the graces of his person, and pleased with the eloquence
of his tongue and the sweetness of his speech; and he said to him,
Approach me. He therefore approached him, and the Khaleefeh said
to him, Explain to me thy tale, and acquaint me with the truth of thy
history. So Gh&aacute;nim sat, and related to the Khaleefeh all that had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
happened to him from beginning to end; and when the Khaleefeh
knew that he spoke truth, he bestowed upon him a dress of honour,
and admitted him into his favour, and said to him, Acquit me of responsibility.<a href="#VII31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
And he did so, and said to him, O Prince of the Faithful,
the slave and all that his hands possess belong to his master:&mdash;and the
Khaleefeh rejoiced. He then gave orders to appropriate a palace to
him exclusively, and appointed him abundant pensions and allowances,
and removed to him his mother and his sister. And the Khaleefeh,
hearing that his sister Fitneh was, in beauty (as her name imported),
a temptation, demanded her of him in marriage. Gh&aacute;nim therefore
replied, She is thy handmaid,<a href="#VII32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and I am thy memlook. And the
Khaleefeh thanked him, and gave him a hundred thousand pieces of
gold,<a href="#VII33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and summoned the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee and witnesses, and they performed
the marriage-contract. Then he and Gh&aacute;nim visited their wives on
the same day, the Khaleefeh going to Fitneh, and Gh&aacute;nim the son
of Eiyoob to &#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob; and on the following morning, the
Khaleefeh ordered that all that had happened to Gh&aacute;nim, from first
to last, should be committed to writing and inserted in the records,
that his posterity might consider it, and wonder at the disposals of
destiny, and commit their affairs unto the Creator of the night and
the day.<a href="#VII34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<h5>NOTES TO CHAPTER SEVENTH.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII1" id="VII1">1.</a></span> Damascus is afterwards mentioned in the original as the abode of this
merchant's family; but not here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII2" id="VII2">2.</a></span> "Gh&aacute;nim" signifies "a taker of spoil," "a fortunate acquirer of anything;"
and "Eiyoob" is the name which <i>we</i> call "Job."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII3" id="VII3">3.</a></span> "Fitneh" signifies "temptation," "seduction," "disturbance," &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII4" id="VII4">4.</a></span> By the term "loads" we are always to understand "camel-loads," unless
it is otherwise expressed. A camel-load is generally about three hundred-weights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII5" id="VII5">5.</a></span> Or vesicles of musk. In the original, "naw&aacute;fe&#7717;" is put for "naw&aacute;fij."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII6" id="VII6">6.</a></span> A great recompense in the world to come is to be the lot of him who
takes part in a funeral-procession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII7" id="VII7">7.</a></span> The ablution was necessary to qualify Gh&aacute;nim for joining in the prayer
over the dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII8" id="VII8">8.</a></span> "&#7778;aw&aacute;b" signifies "rectitude."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII9" id="VII9">9.</a></span> "K&aacute;foor" is the Arabic for "camphor." Instances of antiphrasis in the
names given to black slaves are very common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII10" id="VII10">10.</a></span> "Bakheet" signifies "fortunate," from "bakht" ("fortune"), a word
borrowed from the Persian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII11" id="VII11">11.</a></span> I am not sure that this is to be understood as a jest; for I have been
assured, by a slave-dealer and other persons in Cairo, that sometimes slaves brought to
that city are found to be cannibals; and that a proof lately occurred there; an infant
having been eaten by its black nurse. I was also told that these cannibals are generally
distinguished by an elongation of the os coccygis; or in other words, that they
have tails!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII12" id="VII12">12.</a></span> The story here alluded to is inserted in the original; but, being extremely
objectionable, and too short and simple to be abridged, I have been compelled
to omit it altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII13" id="VII13">13.</a></span> This story is not in the old version; but I think the reader will consider
it worthy of insertion in the present series, as an amusing illustration of the customs
which are often observed by the Arabs on the occasion of the death of the master
of a family. I can bear testimony to the general correctness of the picture which it
presents; or rather state, that the greatest of the extravagances which it describes are
not unfrequently practised in the present day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII14" id="VII14">14.</a></span> As the Arab women are much more reluctant to uncover the upper and
back part of the head than they are to shew the face, before strange men, such a scene
as that which is here described is very seldom witnessed; but I have seen not so unfrequently
a woman with her face uncovered, and besmeared with mud, on her receiving
the news of the sudden death of a near relation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII15" id="VII15">15.</a></span> This, to some readers, may require explanation. To free a slave who has
no means of providing for himself, and not to grant him any means to do so, is almost
the heaviest punishment that can be inflicted upon him; and to do this, unless for a
heinous crime, is considered disgraceful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII16" id="VII16">16.</a></span> This is not just; for as soon as the slave is emancipated he is legally free,
without doubt: but it is inserted in the tale as a jest.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII17" id="VII17">17.</a></span> See Note 46 to Chapter ii.&mdash;This mode of disposing of a rival in the
&#7717;areem is said to have been not very unfrequently adopted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII18" id="VII18">18.</a></span> I suspect that the original presents here an error, which I have endeavoured
to correct.&mdash;The names which the lady ejaculates are to be understood as
those of female slaves, her attendants. "Zahr-el-Bust&aacute;n" signifies "Flower of the
Garden;" "&#7778;abee&#7717;ah," "Beautiful;" "Shejeret-ed-Durr," "Tree of Pearls" (this is
the vulgar mode of pronouncing "Shejer-ed-Durr," which was the name of the wife of
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n E&#7779;-&#7778;&aacute;le&#7717; Nejm-ed-Deen, afterwards Queen of Egypt); "Noor-el-Hud&agrave;,"
"Light of Day," or "Light of Guidance;" "Nejmet-e&#7779;-&#7778;ub&#7717;," "Star of the Morning;"
"Nuzheh," "Delight;" "&#7716;ulweh," "Sweet;" and "&#7826;areefeh," "Elegant."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII19" id="VII19">19.</a></span> From this point, to the relation of the stratagem employed by Zubeydeh,
I omit much that is unsuitable for insertion in the translation, as approaching to
licentiousness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII20" id="VII20">20.</a></span> Perhaps it is unnecessary to mention, that "the Prophet's Uncle" here
alluded to was El-'Abb&aacute;s; and that the "descendant" was H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII21" id="VII21">21.</a></span> "&#7730;oot-el-&#7730;uloob" signifies "Food (or Sustenance) of Hearts."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII22" id="VII22">22.</a></span> As black, which was the distinguishing colour of the banners and dress
of the 'Abb&aacute;see Khaleefehs, was originally assumed in token of mourning for such
of their relations as were victims of the Umawees, it may have continued for a long
time to be used for a similar purpose: but the modern colour of mourning among the
Arabs is blue; and it is remarkable that the term which properly signifies "black" is
commonly applied by them to dark blue.&mdash;On the subject of mourning, see Note 52 to
Chapter ii.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII23" id="VII23">23.</a></span> "Kheyzur&aacute;n" and "&#7730;a&#7693;eeb" signify respectively, "a Cane" (particularly
"Indian Cane"), and "a Rod," or "a long and slender Branch."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII24" id="VII24">24.</a></span> See note 85 to Chapter iii.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII25" id="VII25">25.</a></span> By "the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n" is meant the Viceroy of Damascus, though the title is
improperly used in this sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII26" id="VII26">26.</a></span> The account of the disgusting treatment of Gh&aacute;nim's mother and sister,
which follows in this place in the old version, is not in either of the copies of the
original which I possess, containing this tale. Hence, and as it is extremely inconsistent
with Arab customs and feelings, I have little doubt of its being an interpolation by
some ignorant copyist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII27" id="VII27">27.</a></span> See Note 18 to Chapter vi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII28" id="VII28">28.</a></span> By Gh&aacute;nim's &#7717;areem, we are here to understand his mother and sister;
the term "&#7717;areem" being often used to signify a man's female relations residing in his
house.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII29" id="VII29">29.</a></span> It is implied that she visited the sheykhs (by which are here meant the
devotees) to request the aid of their prayers; and gave alms for the sake (or in the
name) of Gh&aacute;nim in order to propitiate Providence in his favour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII30" id="VII30">30.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Charitable Disposition of the Arabs.</i> Some remarks which I have
made on this subject with reference to the Egyptians, in a former work, are equally
applicable to the Arabs in general. "Benevolence and charity to the poor are virtues
which the Egyptians possess in an eminent degree, and which are instilled into their
hearts by religion; but from their own profession it appears that they are as much
excited to the giving of alms by the expectation of enjoying corresponding rewards in
heaven, as by pity for the distresses of their fellow-creatures, or a disinterested wish to
do the will of God. It may be attributed, in some measure, to the charitable disposition
of the inhabitants, that beggars are so numerous in Cairo. The many handsome
Sebeels, or public fountains (buildings erected and endowed for the gratuitous supply of
water to passengers), which are seen in this city, and the more humble structures of
the same kind in the villages and fields, are monuments of the same virtue."<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> So also
the numerous Kh&aacute;ns for the reception of travellers, in countries occupied by the Arabs,
bear testimony to the charity of this people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII31" id="VII31">31.</a></span> This is often said by an Arab to a person against whom he knows or fears
himself to have committed an offence. The most urgent reason for doing so may be
seen by reverting to No. 9 of the notes to Chapter iv.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII32" id="VII32">32.</a></span> This compliment has occasioned, in the old version, an error of the most
serious kind, by its having been understood in its literal sense. Gh&aacute;nim is made to
propose that the Khaleefeh should take his sister as one of his favourites (<i>i. e.</i> concubines);
which, as she was a free woman, would be a crime of the foulest nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII33" id="VII33">33.</a></span> We are to understand this sum of money as being Fitneh's dowry.&mdash;Here
it may be mentioned, that the Khaleefeh, by marrying Fitneh, severely punished
Zubeydeh: for he thus gave her a wife, instead of a concubine, as a rival.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VII34" id="VII34">34.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Passion of Love among the Arabs.</i> A few remarks on this subject
may be inserted to justify the picture of love presented in the foregoing tale. That
sensual passion is most prevalent among the Arabs cannot be doubted; but I think
it unjust to suppose them generally incapable of a purer feeling, worthy, if constancy
be a sufficient test, of being termed true love. That they are not so, appears evident to
almost every person who mixes with them in familiar society; for such a person must
have opportunities of being acquainted with many Arabs sincerely attached to wives
whose personal charms have long vanished, and who have neither wealth nor influence
of their own, nor wealthy nor influential relations, to induce their husbands to refrain
from divorcing them. It very often happens, too, that an Arab is sincerely attached
to a wife possessed, even in the best portion of her age, of few charms; and that the
lasting favourite among two or more wives is not the most handsome. This opinion,
I am sorry to observe, is at variance, as far as the Arabs of the <i>towns</i> are concerned,
with that entertained by one of the most intelligent and experienced of modern travellers,
who long resided among this people,&mdash;the justly-celebrated Burckhardt:<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>it is confirmed by numerous facts related by respectable Arab authors (and therefore
not regarded by them as of an incredible nature), as well as by cases which have fallen
under my own observation. The tale of Leyl&agrave; and Mejnoon, "the Juliet and Romeo of
Arabia," is too well known to be here repeated; but among many other anecdotes of
strong and constant love, the following may be inserted:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Khaleefeh Yezeed the son of 'Abd-El-Melik, it is said, had two female slaves;
One of whom was named &#7716;abb&aacute;beh, and the other, Sel&aacute;meh; to the former of whom he
was most ardently attached: he had purchased her for a hundred thousand dirhems;
and the other, for ten thousand. In the company of these two females he sometimes
shut himself up for three months together, utterly neglecting the affairs of his people.
At length, being reproved for this conduct by his brother Meslemeh, he promised to
return to his duty: but the two slaves diverted him from his purpose; and on the
following morning, excited by their songs and caresses, and by wine, he became frantic
with pleasure, and danced and sang like a madman, till a fatal accident put a stop to
his joy: &#7716;abb&aacute;beh, eating a pomegranate, was choked by one of the grains, and immediately
died. The grief of Yezeed was so poignant that he would not quit the corpse,
but continued to kiss and fondle it until it became putrid. Being then admonished
by his attendants that proper respect required its burial, he consented to commit it to
the earth: after five days, however, his desire again to behold the object of his love
induced him to open the grave, and though the corpse had become hideous, he declared
that it was lovely as ever in his eyes. At the earnest request of Meslemeh, he ordered
the grave to be closed again; but he was unable to exist when deprived of the sight of
the remains of her who was at the same time his slave and his mistress: he threw
himself upon his bed, speechless; and after lingering seventeen nights, expired, and was
buried by the side of &#7716;abb&aacute;beh. "May God," says the narrator, "have mercy on them
both!"<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></p>

<p>In the same work from which the above is taken, it is related that H&aacute;roon Er-Rasheed,
visiting Suleym&aacute;n the son of Aboo-Ja&#7841;far, one of his chief officers, saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>with him a female slave, named &#7692;a'eefeh, of excessive beauty, and being smitten by
her charms, demanded her as a present. His request was granted; but Suleym&aacute;n
from grief at the loss of his mistress, fell sick; and during his illness was heard to
exclaim,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I appeal unto God against the affliction which He hath sent upon me through the Khaleefeh.</span>
<span class="i0">The world heareth of his justice; but he is a tyrant in the affair of &#7692;a'eefeh.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></span>
<span class="i0">Love of her is fixed in my heart as ink upon the surface of paper."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Er-Rasheed, being informed of his complaint, restored to him his mistress, and, with
her, his peace of mind.&mdash;This anecdote is given as a proof of strong love; but perhaps
may not be thought much to the purpose. The following, from the same work, is
more apt.</p>

<p>During the hottest hour of an excessively sultry day, the Khaleefeh Mo'&aacute;wiyeh the
son of Aboo-Sufy&aacute;n was sitting in a chamber which was open on each side to allow free
passage to the air, when he beheld a barefooted Bedawee approaching him. Wondering
what could induce this man to brave the scorching heat, he declared to his attendants
that, if he were come to demand of him any favour or aid or act of justice, his request
should be granted. The Bedawee addressed him, in verse, with a pathetic appeal for
justice against the tyranny of Marw&aacute;n the son of El-&#7716;akam (afterwards Khaleefeh,
Mo'&aacute;wiyeh's fourth successor), by whom he had been forcibly deprived of his beloved
wife, named So&#7841;d&agrave;. The Khaleefeh requiring a more particular account of his case, he
related the following facts. He had a wife, the daughter of his paternal uncle, excessively
beloved by him, and he possessed a number of camels, which enabled him to live
in comfort; but a year of terrible drought deprived him of his property, and reduced
him to utter want: his friends deserted him, and his wife was taken away from him by
her father. To seek redress, he repaired to Marw&aacute;n, the Governor of his district, at
El-Medeeneh, who, having summoned the father of his wife, and herself, was so smitten
by the beauty of the woman that he determined to obtain her for himself in marriage;
to accomplish which, he threw the husband into prison, and offered the father of the
woman a thousand deen&aacute;rs and ten thousand dirhems for his consent to his marriage
with her, promising to compel her actual husband to divorce her; and this latter object,
having obtained the father's approval, he gained by severely torturing the unfortunate
Bedawee. It would have been vain for the woman to attempt resistance; and so she
became the wife of Marw&aacute;n.&mdash;The oppressed Bedawee, having related these circumstances,
fell down in a swoon, and lay on the floor senseless, coiled up like a dead snake.
As soon as he recovered, the Khaleefeh wrote a poetical epistle to Marw&aacute;n, severely
reproaching him for his baseness, and commanding him, on pain of death, to divorce
the woman and send her with his messenger. She was accordingly divorced and sent,
with an answer composed in the same measure and rhyme, assuring the Khaleefeh that
the sight of So&#7841;d&agrave; would convince him that her charms were irresistible; and this
proved too true. Mo'&aacute;wiyeh himself no sooner saw her than he coveted the possession
of her, and offered to give the Bedawee, if he would resign her to him, three virgins
from among his female slaves, together with a thousand deen&aacute;rs, and an ample annual
pension. The Bedawee shrieked with dismay, as though he had received his death-blow;
and indignantly rejected the offer. The Khaleefeh then said to him, "Thou
confessest that thou hast divorced her, and Marw&aacute;n has married her and acknowledged
that he has divorced her: we will therefore give her her choice: if she desire any other
than thee as her husband we will marry her to him, and if she prefer thee we will
restore her to thee." She however preferred the destitute Bedawee, and the Khaleefeh
gave her up to him, with a present of ten thousand dirhems.</p>

<p>Numerous instances of unreasonable love are recorded in the writings of Arabs. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>is related that a man fell in love with a female from seeing the impression of her hand
upon a wall; and being unable to obtain possession of her, died. Many men are said,
to have conceived a violent passion for females seen in dreams: others, again, to have
been thus affected merely by the ear. An author relates his having been acquainted
with an accomplished schoolmaster who lost his heart from hearing a man sing the
praises of a woman named Umm-'Amr, and two days after, shut himself up in his house
to mourn for her death, in consequence of his hearing the same man sing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The ass went away with Umm-'Amr; and she returned not, nor did the ass return."<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But a few anecdotes may be considered as rare exceptions to a general rule. I
think, however, that strong evidences of the existence of true love among all classes
of the Arabs are afforded by their very numerous tales of fiction descriptive of this
passion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px; position: relative;"><a name="f177" id="f177"></a><img src="images/fig177.png" width="463" height="454" alt="Tail-piece to Notes to Chapter VII.--The Decision" title="Tail-piece to Notes to Chapter VII.--The Decision" /></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_354" id="Footnote_354"></a><a href="#FNanchor_354"><span class="label">354</span></a> Marginal note by my sheykh.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_355" id="Footnote_355"></a><a href="#FNanchor_355"><span class="label">355</span></a> Modern Egyptians, vol. i. ch. xiii.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_356" id="Footnote_356"></a><a href="#FNanchor_356"><span class="label">356</span></a> I may suffer in public estimation for my differing
in opinion from this accomplished traveller
and most estimable man; but I cannot, on that
account, abstain from the expression of my dissent.
Our difference, I think, may be thus explained.
He conformed, in a great degree, to the habits of
the Arabs; but not to such an extent as I consider
necessary to obtain from them that confidence in
his sympathy which would induce them to lay
open to him their character; and when a man is
often treated with coldness and reserve, I doubt
whether the people from whom he experiences
such treatment can be judged by him with strict
impartiality. To be received on terms of equality
by Arabs of the more polished classes, an undeviating
observance of their code of etiquette is absolutely
indispensable: but Burckhardt, I have been
assured, often violated this code, by practices harmless
enough to our notions, and probably, also, in
the opinion of the Arabs of the Desert, but extremely
offensive to the people who enjoyed the least share
of his esteem: his most intimate acquaintances in
Cairo generally refused, in speaking of him, to
designate him by the title of "sheykh" which he
had adopted; and yet the heaviest charge that I
heard brought against him was his frequent habit
of <i>whistling</i>!&mdash;This fact has been mentioned, as
corroborating an observation of the same kind, by
Mr. Urquhart ("Spirit of the East," vol. i. pp. 417
and 418), all of whose opinions relating to the
East, expressed in the work here referred to, and
especially those regarding the characteristics of
the Eastern <i>mind</i>, are entitled to the highest
respect.
</p><p>
[A very remarkable instance, confirming Mr.
Lane's opinion of the existence of true love
among the Arabs, occurred during my residence
with him in Cairo. The wife of a man of good
birth, and holding a high position in that city, was
accused of carrying on an intrigue while visiting
the tombs of her relations. Her family claimed
her in accordance with the law, and threatened to
put her to death, as the law would undoubtedly
have justified them in doing, if the case were
proved against her. Her husband was much attached
to her&mdash;she was his first and only wife&mdash;and
he believed, with reason, that the accusation was
false: at the same time he knew that she would
in all likelihood find it impossible to clear herself
in a court of law, where justice is only accidentally
awarded, and had good cause to fear that her male
relations would put her to death without a hearing.
He therefore adopted the extraordinary expedient
of taking her secretly to the house of a married
European gentleman of his acquaintance. There
she remained concealed for some time, her husband
visiting her daily, and shewing the most perfect
confidence in his friend; while the latter was
almost confined to one room, never venturing into
the &#7717;areem without calling "Permission!" at every
few steps. In the mean time, the indignation of
the lady's friends cooled, and the affair was cleared
up. She has since lived in perfect happiness with
her husband.
</p><p>
To any one familiar with Eastern customs and
modes of thought, a stronger proof of sincere love
could scarcely be given, than that a man should
thus set aside the strongest prejudices of his
nation to save the honour, and perhaps the life, of
his wife, disbelieving a report which, from its
plausibility, might have been accepted without
hesitation. The facilities afforded by the visits to
the cemeteries are notorious, and the state of
morals among the women of Egypt unfortunately
makes their defence difficult in a suspicious
case.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p></div>

WITH PART OF THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SEVENTH.</h6>

<hr />
<h5>THE STORY OF T&Aacute;J-EL-MULOOK AND THE LADY DUNY&Agrave;.</h5>

<p>There was, in former times, a city behind the mountains of
I&#7779;pah&aacute;n, called El-Medeeneh el-Kha&#7693;r&agrave;,<a href="#VIII2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and in it resided a King
called the King Suleym&aacute;n. He was a person of liberality and
beneficence, and justice and integrity, and of a generous and obliging
disposition: travellers repaired to him from every quarter, and his
fame spread throughout all the regions and countries; and he reigned
a long time in glory and security; but he was destitute of children
and of wives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span></p>

<p>He had a Wezeer who nearly resembled him in his qualities, in
liberality and other endowments; and it came to pass that he sent
to this Wezeer one day, and having summoned him into his presence,
said to him, O Wezeer, my heart is contracted, and my patience is
overcome, and my strength is impaired, because I have neither a wife
nor a child: this is not the usual way of Kings who rule over lords
and poor men; for they rejoice in leaving children, and multiplying
by them the number of their posterity; and the Prophet (God bless
and save him!) hath said, Intermarry, and beget offspring, that ye
may increase in number; for I shall contend for your superiority with
the other nations on the day of resurrection.&mdash;What, then, is thy
counsel, O Wezeer? Point out to me what is advisable.&mdash;But when
the Wezeer heard these words, tears poured from his eyes, and he
replied, Far be it from me, O King of the age, that I should speak of
that which belongeth unto the Compassionate to decide!<a href="#VIII3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Dost thou
desire that I should enter the fire of Hell, through the anger of the
Almighty King?&mdash;Know, O Wezeer, rejoined his sovereign, that, if
the King purchase a female slave whose rank and lineage are unknown,
he will not be acquainted with her ignoble origin that he may abstain
from her, or the nobility of her extraction that he may make her his
companion: so, if he do this, she may perhaps bear him a son who
may be a hypocrite, a tyrant, a shedder of blood; and she may
resemble a marshy land, the produce of which is worthless, and
attaineth no excellence: her child may be obnoxious to the indignation
of his Lord, not doing what He commandeth him, nor refraining
from that which He forbiddeth him to do. I will never, therefore, be
the means of such an event by purchasing a female slave. I desire,
rather, that thou demand in marriage for me one of the daughters of
the Kings, whose lineage is known, and whose loveliness is celebrated.
If, then, thou wilt point out to me one of good birth and of religion
among the daughters of the Muslim Kings, I will demand her as my
wife, and marry her in the presence of witnesses, that I may thereby
obtain the approval of the Lord of mankind.&mdash;The Wezeer replied,
Verily God hath accomplished thy want and given thee thy desire.&mdash;How
so? asked the King.&mdash;Know, O King, answered the Wezeer,
that it hath been told me that the King Zahr Sh&aacute;h, the sovereign of
El-Ar&#7693; el-Bey&#7693;&agrave;,<a href="#VIII4" class="fnanchor">4</a> hath a daughter of astonishing loveliness, whom
words cannot describe, whose equal existeth not in this age, for she is
endowed with the most perfect beauty and symmetry, with black eye,
and long hair, and slender waist, and large hips; when she approach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>eth
she seduceth, and when she turneth her back she killeth, ravishing
the heart and the eye. It is my opinion, therefore, O King, that
thou shouldst send to her father an intelligent messenger, well-informed,
and experienced in the course of events, that he may
courteously ask her in marriage for thee of her father; for she hath
no equal in the distant parts of the earth, nor in the near; so shalt
thou enjoy her lovely face, and the Glorious King shall approve thy
conduct; since it hath been handed down from the Prophet (God
bless and save him!) that he said, There is no monkery in El-Isl&aacute;m.</p>

<p>Upon this, the King was perfectly delighted, his bosom expanded
with joy, and anxiety and grief departed from him; and, addressing
his Wezeer, he said to him, Know, O Wezeer, that no one shall go on
this business but thou, on account of thy consummate wisdom and
politeness: depart, therefore, to thy house, and accomplish what thou
hast to do, and prepare thyself by the morrow, and demand for me in
marriage this damsel with whom thou hast caused my heart to be
engrossed, and return not to me without her. The Wezeer replied, I
hear and obey:&mdash;and he went to his house, and gave orders to bring
presents suitable to Kings, consisting of costly jewels and precious
rarities, such as were light to carry and of great value, together with
Arab horses, and Davidean coats of mail,<a href="#VIII5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and chests of wealth such
as language would fail to describe. These they placed upon the mules
and camels, and the Wezeer departed, accompanied by a hundred
memlooks and a hundred male black slaves and a hundred female
slaves, and the flags and banners were unfurled over his head. The
King charged him to return soon; and after his departure, the King
Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h burned with desire, and became engrossed with love
of the damsel night and day. Meanwhile, the Wezeer, by night and
by day traversed the deserts and wastes until there remained between
him and the city to which he was repairing one day's journey, when
he alighted at the bank of a river, and, having summoned one of his
chief officers, ordered him to go quickly to the King Zahr Sh&aacute;h, and
to acquaint him with his approach. He answered, I hear and obey:&mdash;and
went quickly to the city; and when he arrived there, it happened
that the King Zahr Sh&aacute;h was sitting in one of the places of recreation
before the gate of the city, and, seeing him as he entered, knew him
to be a stranger, and summoned him before him. So when the
messenger came to him, he informed him of the approach of the
Wezeer of the supreme King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, the King of El-Ar&#7693;
el-Kha&#7693;r&agrave; and of the mountains of I&#7779;pah&aacute;n; and the King Zahr<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
Sh&aacute;h rejoiced, and welcomed the messenger, and, having conducted
him to his palace, said to him, Where didst thou part from the
Wezeer? He answered, I parted from him in the morning at the
bank of such a river, and to-morrow he will arrive and visit thee:
may God continue his favours unto thee, and show mercy unto thy
parents!<a href="#VIII6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Zahr Sh&aacute;h then ordered one of his wezeers to take with
him the greater number of his chief officers and chamberlains and
lieutenants and the lords of his court, and to go forth with them to
meet him, in honour of the King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h; for his dominion
extended through the land.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Wezeer of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h remained where
he had halted until midnight, and then proceeded towards the city;
and when the morning gleamed, and the sun shone upon the hills and
the lowlands, suddenly the Wezeer of the King Zahr Sh&aacute;h, and his
chamberlains and the lords of his court and the chief officers of his
kingdom, approached and joined him at the distance of some leagues
from the city. So the Wezeer of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h felt sure of the
accomplishment of his business, and saluted those who met him; and
the latter preceded him until they arrived at the palace of the King,
and passed in before him through the entrance to the seventh
vestibule. This was the place which no one entered on horseback;
for it was near to the King; therefore here the Wezeer alighted, and
he proceeded on foot until he came to a lofty saloon, at the upper end
of which was a couch of alabaster set with pearls and jewels, having
four legs of elephants' tusks, and upon it was a mattress covered with
green satin embroidered with red gold, and over it was a canopy
adorned with pearls and jewels. Upon this couch sat the King Zahr
Sh&aacute;h, and the lords of his court stood in attendance upon him. And
when the Wezeer went in unto him, and stood before him, he composed
his heart, and gave liberty to his tongue, and, displaying the
oratory of wezeers, and uttering the language of the eloquent,
addressed the King with courtesy of manner, and recited a series of
complimentary verses; and when he had finished, the King caused
him to draw near, treated him with the utmost respect, and, seating
him by his side, smiled in his face, and honoured him with a gracious
reply. After this, the attendants brought forward the table in that
saloon, and they ate until they were satisfied, when the attendants
removed the table, and every one who was present went forth, except
the chief officers. When the Wezeer, therefore, saw that they had
quitted the hall, he rose and stood on his feet, and, complimenting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
King, kissed the ground before him, and said, O great King, and
dignified sovereign, I have come unto thee and visited thee on an
affair productive of peace and prosperity and happiness unto thee;
and it is this: I have come to thee as an ambassador to desire in
marriage thy daughter, the distinguished by rank and lineage, from
the King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, who is endowed with justice and integrity,
and graciousness and beneficence, the King of El-Ar&#7693; el-Kha&#7693;r&agrave; and
of the mountains of I&#7779;pah&aacute;n, and he hath sent unto thee many
presents and numerous rarities, desiring thine alliance. Dost thou
then wish the same of him?&mdash;He then stood silent, waiting for the
answer; and when the King Zahr Sh&aacute;h heard these words, he rose
upon his feet, and modestly kissed the ground; and the persons who
were present wondered at the King's condescension to the ambassador,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
and their minds were amazed. The King then offered up praises
unto Him who is possessed of glory and honour, and said, still standing,
O exalted Wezeer, and illustrious lord, hear what I say: we are,
unto the King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, among the number of his subjects,
and shall be ennobled by his affinity: we covet this distinction; and
my daughter is one of his handmaids. This is my greatest desire;
that he may be a means of support to me, and my reliance.&mdash;And he
summoned the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ees and witnesses, and they bore witness that the
King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h had appointed his Wezeer as his deputy to
effect the marriage, and the King Zahr Sh&aacute;h joyfully officiated for
his daughter in performing the contract; so the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ees concluded the
marriage-contract, and offered up a prayer for the happiness and
prosperity of both parties: after which, the Wezeer arose, and produced
the presents and precious rarities, and all the gifts that he had
brought, and offered the whole to the King Zahr Sh&aacute;h.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 529px; position: relative;"><a name="f179" id="f179"></a><img src="images/fig179.png" width="529" height="610" alt="Zahr Sh&aacute;h on his Throne" title="Zahr Sh&aacute;h on his Throne" /></div>

<p>The King then occupied himself in fitting out his daughter, and
in honourably entertaining the Wezeer; and he feasted at his
banquets the great and the abject, and continued the festivity for a
period of two months, omitting in it nothing that would rejoice the
heart and the eye.<a href="#VIII7" class="fnanchor">7</a> And when everything that the bride required was
completed, the King gave orders to carry forth the tents, and they
were pitched outside the city. They packed the stuffs in the chests,
and made ready the Greek and Turkish female slaves; and the King
provided the bride with precious treasures and costly jewels, and made
for her a litter<a href="#VIII8" class="fnanchor">8</a> of red gold adorned with pearls and jewels, appropriating
to her use ten mules for the journey. The litter appeared
like a private chamber, and its occupant like one of the beautiful
&#7716;ooreeyehs,<a href="#VIII9" class="fnanchor">9</a> her canopy resembling one of the pavilions of Paradise.
They packed up the treasures and wealth, and placed them upon the
mules and camels, and the King Zahr Sh&aacute;h went with them to the
distance of three leagues, and then bade farewell to his daughter and
the Wezeer and his attendants, and returned home in joy and safety.</p>

<p>The Wezeer proceeded with the King's daughter, and continued
his days' journeys and his route over the wastes, travelling with
diligence by night and day, until there remained between him and
his country a journey of three days; whereupon he sent forward a
messenger to the King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h to inform him of the approach
of the bride. So the messenger hasted in his journey till he arrived
in the presence of the King, and acquainted him with the approach of
the bride; and the King was rejoiced, and bestowed a robe of honour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>

<span class="figright3" style="width: 606px; position: relative;"><a name="f181a" id="f181a"></a><img src="images/fig181a.png" width="606" height="165" alt="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" title="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" /></span>
<span class="figright3" style="width: 203px; position: relative;"><a name="f181b" id="f181b"></a><img src="images/fig181b.png" width="203" height="226" alt="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" title="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" /></span>
<span class="figright3" style="width: 240px; position: relative;"><a name="f181c" id="f181c"></a><img src="images/fig181c.png" width="240" height="218" alt="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" title="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" /></span>
<span class="figright3" style="width: 204px; position: relative;"><a name="f181d" id="f181d"></a><img src="images/fig181d.png" width="204" height="346" alt="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" title="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" /></span>

upon the messenger, and ordered his troops to go
forth in grand procession to meet the bride and her
attendants with honour, desiring them to equip
themselves in the gayest manner, and to unfurl the
standards over their heads. And they complied
with his commands; and a crier proclaimed through
the city, that no curtained damsel nor honoured
lady nor infirm old woman should fail to go forth
to meet the bride. So they all went forth to
meet her, and the chief among them accompanied
her to serve her. They decided together to
conduct her towards night to the King's palace,
and the chief officers of the court agreed to
decorate the streets, and to stand while the
bride passed by them with the eunuchs and
female slaves before her, she herself being clad
in the dress which her father gave her. And
when she approached, the troops surrounded
her, ranged on the right and left, and the litter
advanced with her until it drew near to the palace;
and there was no one who did not come forth to
see it: the drums were beaten, and the spears
brandished, and the trumpets sounded, and sweet
odours were diffused around, and the standards
flapped, and the horses raced with each other, until
they arrived at the gate of the palace, when the
pages advanced with the litter to the entrance of

<span class="figleft3" style="width: 146px; position: relative;"><a name="f181e" id="f181e"></a><img src="images/fig181e.png" width="146" height="166" alt="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" title="The Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h meeting his Bride" /></span>

the &#7716;areem: the palace was
illuminated by its splendour,
and its walls shone with the
lustre of its ornaments; and
at night the eunuchs opened
the doors of the inner apartment,
and stood surrounding
the chief entrance. The bride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
then came forward among the female slaves, like the moon among the
stars, or the chief pearl among the minor pearls of the string, and she
entered the apartment, where they had placed for her a couch of
alabaster set with pearls and jewels. Upon this she seated herself,
and the King came in to visit her, and God inspired his heart with
love for her, so that his disquietude and trouble ceased.</p>

<p>He remained with her about a month, after which he went forth
and sat upon his throne, and administered justice to his subjects; and
towards daybreak on the morning after the expiration of the ninth
month, his wife gave birth to a male child of an auspicious appearance.
When the King heard of it, he rejoiced exceedingly, and gave a large
sum of money to the bearer of the good tidings; and in his joy he
went to the child, and kissed him between the eyes, wondering at his
surpassing beauty. The midwives took him, and blackened the edges of
his eyelids with ko&#7717;l;<a href="#VIII10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and they named him T&aacute;j-el-Mulook Kh&aacute;r&aacute;n.<a href="#VIII11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
He was nourished on the bosom of indulgence, and reared in the lap
of prosperity, and days and years passed until he attained the age of
seven years; whereupon the King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h summoned the
men of learning and science, and ordered them to instruct his son in
writing and science and polite literature, and they continued to do so
for some years, until he had learnt what was requisite; and when he
was acquainted with all that the King desired, he caused him to be
brought from the professors and teachers, and engaged for him a
master to instruct him in horsemanship, who continued to teach him
until his pupil was fourteen years of age. Whenever the youth went
forth on any business, every one who beheld him was ravished by his
beauty, so that they composed verses in his praise, and even the
women of virtue were overcome by love for him, through the surpassing
beauty with which he was endowed. And when he had attained
the age of eighteen years, the grey down appeared upon a mole on
his red cheek, while another mole, like a globule of ambergris, added
to these charms, and he captivated the minds and eyes of his beholders.
His comeliness increased as he became a man, and he had companions
and friends, and every one who enjoyed access to him wished that
T&aacute;j-el-Mulook might be Sul&#7789;&aacute;n after the death of his father, and that
he might himself be one of his emeers.</p>

<p>Now T&aacute;j-el-Mulook became addicted to hunting, and would not
desist from it for a single hour. His father, the King, used to forbid
him this pursuit, fearing, on his account, the perils of the desert and
the wild beasts; but he would not receive his warnings. And it came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>

<span class="figleft3" style="width: 156px; position: relative;"><a name="f182" id="f182"></a><img src="images/fig182.png" width="156" height="177" alt="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook hunting" title="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook hunting" /></span>

to pass that he said to his servants, Take with
you provender for ten days. And they complied
with his order; and when he went forth with his
followers to the chase, they proceeded over the
desert, and continued their course for four days,
until they came in sight of a verdant tract, where
they beheld wild beasts ranging at large, and
trees with ripe fruit, and springs gushing forth;
so he said to his followers, Set here the nets, and enlarge their circle,
and our place of meeting shall be at the extremity of the circle, at
such a spot. They therefore obeyed his commands:

<span class="figright3" style="width: 206px; position: relative;"><a name="f183a" id="f183a"></a><img src="images/fig183a.png" width="206" height="325" alt="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook hunting" title="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook hunting" /></span>
<span class="figright3" style="width: 592px; position: relative;"><a name="f183b" id="f183b"></a><img src="images/fig183b.png" width="592" height="350" alt="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook hunting" title="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook hunting" /></span>

they set the nets, and enlarged their
circle, and there collected within them an abundance
and a variety of wild beasts and gazelles, in
such numbers that the wild beasts cried out in
fear of them, and threw themselves in the faces
of the horses in their attempts to escape. So he
urged the dogs and the lynxes<a href="#VIII12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and the hawks
at them; and they shot the wild beasts with
arrows, striking them in mortal places, and they
arrived not at the further extremity of the circle
without having taken, of the wild beasts, a great
number; the rest having fled away. T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
then alighted at some water, and, having
caused the game to be brought before him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
divided it: he appropriated to his father, Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, the best of
the beasts, and despatched the portion to him; and some he distributed
among the officers of his court.</p>

<p>They passed the night at that place; and in the morning there
approached them a great caravan, comprising black slaves and servants
and merchants. The caravan halted at the water and the verdant
tract; and when T&aacute;j-el-Mulook beheld them, he said to one of his
companions, Bring me an account of these people, and ask them
wherefore they have halted in this place. And when the messenger
went to them, he said to them, Inform us who ye are, and return an
answer quickly. So they replied, We are merchants, and have halted
here for the sake of rest, for the next station is distant from us; and
we have halted in this place because we here enjoy tranquillity under
the protection of the King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h and his son; for we know
that every one who alighteth in his dominions is in safety and peace;
and we have some precious stuffs which we have brought on account
of his son T&aacute;j-el-Mulook. The messenger, therefore, returned to the
King's son, and acquainted him with the truth of the matter, informing
him of what he had heard from the merchants; and the King's
son said, If they have anything which they have brought on my
account, I will not enter the city nor remove from this place until I
cause it to be displayed before me. He then mounted his horse, and
proceeded, his memlooks following him, until he drew near to the
caravan; and the merchants rose to him, and greeted him with prayers
for the divine aid and favour, and the continuance of his glory and his
excellencies. A tent of red satin embroidered with pearls and jewels
was pitched for him, and they spread for him, over a carpet of silk, a
royal carpet, the upper end of which was adorned with emeralds: and
T&aacute;j-el-Mulook seated himself, and the memlooks stood waiting upon
him; and he sent to the merchants, commanding them to bring everything
that they had with them. So they approached him with their
merchandise, and he caused all of it to be displayed before him, and
took of it what suited him, and gave them the price.</p>

<p>After this, he mounted, and was about to depart; when, casting a
glance at the caravan, he saw a young man, a comely youth, attired in
clean clothes, of elegant person, with shining forehead and brilliant
countenance; but the charms of this youth had suffered a change, and
paleness had overspread him, in consequence of his separation from the
objects of his affection; great was his groaning and lamentation, and,
with tears flowing from his eyes, he recited these verses:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our separation is protracted, and anxiety and fear are prolonged; and tears from my eye, O my friend, are flowing.</span>
<span class="i0">I bade farewell to my heart on the day of parting, and now I am alone, without heart, and without hope.</span>
<span class="i0">O my friend, pause with me while I bid her farewell by whose voice diseases and infirmities would be cured.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having thus said, he wept a while, and fell down in a swoon, while
T&aacute;j-el-Mulook looked at him, wondering at his case; and when he
recovered, he stared with a bold look, and again recited some verses,
commencing thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beware of her eye; for it is enchanting, and none escapeth upon whom it is cast.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then uttered a loud sigh, and a second time swooned; and when
T&aacute;j-el-Mulook beheld him in this state, he was perplexed at his case,
and walked towards him; and as soon as he recovered from his fit,
he saw the King's son standing at his head; whereupon he rose upon
his feet, and kissed the ground before him; and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook said
to him, Wherefore hast thou not displayed thy merchandise to us?&mdash;O
my lord, he answered, my merchandise compriseth nothing suitable
to thy highness. But the King's son said, Thou must positively shew
me what thou hast, and acquaint me with thy circumstances; for I
see thee with weeping eye and mourning heart; and if thou be
oppressed, we will put an end to the oppression that thou sufferest;
and if thou be in debt, we will discharge thy debt; for my heart hath
been tormented on thine account since I first beheld thee.</p>

<p>Then T&aacute;j-el-Mulook gave orders to place a chair; and they set for
him a chair of ivory and ebony ornamented with reticulated work of
gold and silk, and they spread for him a silken carpet; and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
seated himself upon the chair, and commanded the young
man to sit upon the carpet, and said to him, Display to me thy merchandise.
The young man replied, O my lord, mention it not unto
me; for my merchandise is not suitable to thee. But T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
said to him, It must be done:&mdash;and ordered some of his pages to
bring it: so they brought it in spite of him; and when the young
man beheld it, his tears flowed, and he wept and sighed and lamented,
and groans rose from his throat. After again repeating some verses,
he opened his merchandise, and displayed it before T&aacute;j-el-Mulook,
portion by portion and piece by piece, and took forth from among it a
garment of satin interwoven with gold, worth two thousand pieces of
gold; and when he opened this, there fell from the midst of it a piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
of linen, and the young man, snatching it hastily, put it beneath him,
his reason wandering, and thus exclaimed.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When will the tortured heart be healed by thee? The constellation of the Pleiades is nearer to me than thou!</span>
</div>

<p>T&aacute;j-el-Mulook was struck with the utmost wonder at his words, not
knowing the cause of them; and when the young man took the piece
of linen, and put it beneath him, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook said to him, What is
this piece of linen? He answered, O my lord, thou hast no interest in
this. But the King's son said, Shew it to me.&mdash;O my lord, he replied,
I refrained not from exposing to thee my merchandise but on account
of this; for I cannot allow thee to see it. T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, however,
said, I must see it:&mdash;and he urged him, and was angry. The young
man, therefore, took it from beneath his knee, and wept and sighed
and lamented exceedingly: so T&aacute;j-el-Mulook said to him, I regard
thy conduct as not right: acquaint me then with the cause of thy
weeping at beholding this piece of linen. And when the young man
heard the mention of the piece of linen, he sighed, and said, O my lord,
my story is wonderful, and my case is strange with respect to this
piece of linen and her to whom it belonged, and her who designed
these figures and emblems. He then unfolded the piece of linen; and
lo, in it was the figure of a gazelle worked with silk, and embroidered
with red gold, and facing it was the figure of another gazelle worked
with silver, and having upon its neck a ring of red gold and three
&#7731;a&#7779;abehs<a href="#VIII13" class="fnanchor">13</a> of chrysolite. When T&aacute;j-el-Mulook beheld this, and
observed the beauty of its execution, he exclaimed, Extolled be the
perfection of God, who hath taught man that which he knew not!<a href="#VIII14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
And his heart was engrossed with desire to hear the story of this
young man; so he said to him, Relate to me the story of thyself and
of her who was the owner of these gazelles. The young man, therefore,
replied,&mdash;</p>

<h5>THE STORY OF 'AZEEZ AND 'AZEEZEH.</h5>

<p>Know, O my lord, that my father was a great merchant, and he
was blest with no child but me. I had a cousin (the daughter of a
paternal uncle) with whom I was brought up in my father's house;
for her father had died, and before his death he had made an agreement
with my father that they should marry me to her: so, when I
had attained to manhood, and she to womanhood, they did not exclude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
her from me, nor me from her. My father then spoke to my mother,
and said to her, This year we will perform the marriage-contract of
'Azeez and 'Azeezeh.<a href="#VIII15" class="fnanchor">15</a> And having agreed with my mother to do this,
he began to make ready the provisions for the entertainments.</p>

<p>All this was done while I and my cousin were living together
without the slightest restraint, and ignorant of the circumstance; and
she was more intelligent and more knowing than I. And when my
father had made the preparations for the festivity, and nothing
remained but the performance of the contract, and my union to my
cousin, my father proposed that they should perform the contract after
the Friday-prayers: so he repaired to his friends, the merchants and
others, and acquainted them with his intention; and my mother went
and invited her female friends and relations. And when the Friday
came, they washed the saloon which was appropriated to the guests,
and cleansed its marble pavement, and spread the carpets in our house,
and furnished it with everything that was requisite, after they had
decorated its walls with stuffs interwoven with gold; the people having
agreed to pay their compliments to our family after the Friday-prayers.
My father then went and caused sweetmeats and dishes of sugar to be
prepared; and there remained nothing but the performance of the
contract. My mother had sent me to the bath, and sent after me a
new suit of clothes of the richest description; and on my coming out
from the bath, I put on this handsome suit, which was perfumed; and
when I put it on, a delicious odour was diffused from it, and left a
fragrance in the way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px; position: relative;"><a name="f184" id="f184"></a><img src="images/fig184.png" width="509" height="688" alt="Descent of the Handkerchief" title="Descent of the Handkerchief" /></div>

<p>I desired now to repair to the mosque; but, remembering one of
my friends, I returned to search for him, that he might be present at
the ceremony of the contract, saying within myself, I will busy me
with this affair until the time of prayer draws near. I then entered a
by-street which I had never entered before. I was perspiring from
the effect of the bath and the new clothes which I wore, and the
moisture dropped from me while my perfumes diffused their odour;
so I seated myself at the upper end of the street to take rest upon a
ma&#7779;&#7789;abah, and spread beneath me an embroidered handkerchief that I
had with me. The heat became oppressive to me, and my forehead
perspired, and the drops ran down my face, and I could not wipe the
moisture from it with my handkerchief because it was spread beneath
me: I was therefore about to take the skirt of my farajeeyeh to wipe with
it my cheek, when suddenly a white handkerchief fell upon me from
above. This handkerchief was more delicate to the feel than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
zephyr, and the sight of it was more pleasant than restoration to the
diseased; and I took it in my hand, and, raising my head to see
whence it had fallen, my eye met the eye of the female who owned
these gazelles; and lo, she was looking out from a lattice in a window
of brass. My eye never beheld a person more lovely, and altogether
her charms were such as the tongue cannot describe; and when she
saw me looking at her, she put her finger in her mouth, and then
united her middle finger and her fore finger, and placed them upon
her bosom; after which, she drew in her head from the window, and
shut the lattice and withdrew. A fire had been darted into my heart,
and the flame increased; the sight drew from me a thousand sighs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
and I was perplexed; for I heard not anything from her, and understood
not what she meant by her signs. I looked again towards the
window; but found it closed: and I waited until sunset; but heard
no sound, nor saw any person; so, despairing of seeing her again, I
rose from my place, and took the handkerchief with me. I opened it,
and the odour of musk was diffused from it, and I was so exhilarated
by the scent that I seemed as if I were in paradise. I then spread it
before me; whereupon there fell from it a piece of delicate paper, and,
opening this, I found it richly perfumed with exquisite scents, and
inscribed with these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sent a letter to complain to him of the pain of my passion, in a delicate handwriting (for handwritings are various);</span>
<span class="i0">So my beloved said, Wherefore is thy writing thus delicate and minute, so as scarce to be discernible?</span>
<span class="i0">I answered, Because I am wasted and attenuated: so, therefore, should the writing of lovers be.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>After this, I cast a glance at the beauty of the handkerchief, and
beheld an amatory couplet worked upon one of its two borders,<a href="#VIII16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and
another, of a similar kind, on its other border.</p>

<p>When I saw these verses upon the handkerchief, a flame of fire
shot into my heart, and my desire and perplexity increased; and I
took the handkerchief and the paper, and went with them to the
house, not knowing any means of obtaining what I desired, and
incapable of discovering how to proceed properly in my love. I
arrived not at the house until a considerable portion of the night had
elapsed, and beheld my cousin sitting weeping; but when she saw me,
she wiped away her tears, and approached me, and took off from me
my outer clothes, and asked me the cause of my absence. She told
me that all the people, the emeers and grandees, and merchants and
others, had assembled in our house, and the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee and the witnesses
had come, and they ate the repast, and remained a considerable while
sitting in expectation of my presence for the purpose of performing
the marriage-contract, and when they despaired of my coming, they
dispersed and went their ways.&mdash;Thy father, said she, was violently
enraged on account of this, and swore that he would not perform our
marriage-contract until next year; for he hath expended upon this
festivity a large sum of money. What, she added, hath happened
unto thee this day, that thou hast delayed thy return until now, and
that this hath happened on account of thine absence?</p>

<p>I answered her, Such and such things have happened to me:&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
mentioned to her the handkerchief, acquainting her with the affair
from first to last: and she took the paper and the handkerchief, and
read what was upon them, and her tears ran down upon her cheeks;
and she asked me, What did she say to thee, and of what did she
make signs to thee? I answered, She uttered not a word; but put
her finger in her mouth, and then united it with the middle finger, and
placed both fingers upon her bosom, and pointed to the ground: then
she drew in her head, and closed the lattice, and I saw her not afterwards.
She carried off my heart with her, and I sat until sunset in
expectation of her looking out from the lattice a second time; but she
did it not; and when I despaired of seeing her again, I rose from the
place. This is my story; and I beg of thee to aid me in the trouble
in which I am involved.&mdash;Upon this, she raised her head towards me,
and said, O son of my uncle, if thou requiredst mine eye, I would pull
it out for thee from my eyelids; and I must assist thee in the accomplishment
of thy desire, and assist her in like manner; for she is overwhelmed
by love for thee, as thou art by love for her.&mdash;And what,
said I, is the interpretation of the signs which she made?&mdash;Her
putting her finger in her mouth, she answered, indicateth that thou
art in her estimation as her soul to her body,<a href="#VIII17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and that she longeth
for thy union with her; and as to the handkerchief, it is a signal of
the lover's salutation to the beloved; and the paper denoteth that her
soul is captivated by thee; and as to her putting her two fingers upon
her bosom, the meaning of it is as though she said to thee, After two
days come hither, that my affliction may be dissipated by thy countenance.<a href="#VIII18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
And know, O son of my uncle, she continued, that she
loveth thee and confideth in thee. This is my interpretation of her
signs; and if I had liberty to go in and out at pleasure, I would effect
thy union with her in the shortest time, and protect you both with my
skirt.&mdash;When I heard these words from her, said the young man, I
thanked her for what she had said, and I said within myself, I will
wait two days. I then remained two days in the house, neither going
out nor coming in, nor eating nor drinking. I put my head in the
lap of my cousin; and she cheered me by her conversation, and said
to me, Be resolute and of good heart, and dress thyself, and repair to
her at the time appointed. And she arose, and changed my clothes,
and perfumed me with incense.</p>

<p>I then braced up my nerves, and fortified my heart, and went
forth, and proceeded until I entered the by-street, and after I had sat
a while upon the ma&#7779;&#7789;abah, lo, the lattice opened. I looked towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
damsel, and when I saw her I fell down in a swoon: then recovering,
I summoned resolution, and took heart, and looked at her a second
time; but again I became insensible; and when I recovered, I saw
with her a mirror and a red handkerchief. Observing me now, she
tucked up her sleeves from her fore arms, and, opening her five fingers,
struck her bosom with them (with the palm and the five fingers):
next she raised her hands, and held forth the mirror from the lattice,
and took the red handkerchief, and retired with it; after which she
returned, and let it down from the lattice towards the street three
times, letting it down and raising it, and then wringing it and twisting
it with her hand, and bending down her head: she then drew it in
through the lattice, and closed the lattice, and departed, without
speaking to me one word, but leaving me in perplexity, not knowing
to what she alluded. I remained sitting there until the hour of nightfall,
and went home near midnight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px; position: relative;"><a name="f185" id="f185"></a><img src="images/fig185.png" width="489" height="446" alt="'Azeez and 'Azeezeh" title="'Azeez and 'Azeezeh" /></div>

<p>I found my cousin with her hand placed to her cheek, and her
eyelids pouring forth tears; and upon this, my anxieties and griefs
increased, and I fell down in a corner of the chamber; but she sprang
towards me, and lifted me up, and, having taken off from me my outer
clothes, wiped my face with her sleeve, and asked me what had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
happened to me. I related to her, therefore, all that had happened on
the part of the damsel: and she said to me, O son of my uncle, as to
her sign with her hand and five fingers, its interpretation is, Come
hither after five days:&mdash;and as to her sign with the mirror, and her
putting forth her head from the lattice [and her actions with the red
handkerchief],<a href="#VIII19" class="fnanchor">19</a> the meaning is, Seat thyself at the shop of the dyer
until my messenger shall come to thee.&mdash;When I heard her words, fire
burned in my heart, and I replied, By Allah, O daughter of my uncle,
thou sayest truly in this interpretation; for I saw in the by-street a
Jewish dyer. I then wept, and my cousin said, Be resolute, and firm
of heart; for others than thou are troubled with love for a period of
years, and contend with the fierceness of passion, while thou hast but
a week to endure: wherefore then should this impatience overcome
thee? And she proceeded to cheer me with her conversation, and
brought me food; and I took a morsel, and would have eaten it; but
I could not. I abstained from drink and food, and renounced the
delights of sleep, and my complexion became pallid, and my charms
became changed; for I had never known love before that, nor tasted
the fervency of that passion before; and I fell sick, and my cousin
became sick on my account. She occupied herself in relating to me
the sufferings of lovers, in order to enliven me, until I fell asleep; and
I used to awake, and find her sleepless on my account, with her tears
flowing upon her cheeks; and thus I remained until the five days had
passed, when my cousin arose, and heated some water for me, and
bathed me with it, and dressed me, and said to me, Repair to her, and
may Allah accomplish thy wish, and grant thee what thou desirest of
thy beloved.</p>

<p>So I went, and walked on until I came to the upper end of the
by-street, and that day was Saturday; so I found the shop of the dyer
shut: and I sat there till the call to afternoon-prayers; and the sun
became yellow, and the call to evening-prayers was chanted; and
night commenced, and I saw no trace of her, nor heard a voice, nor
received any message: I therefore feared for myself, sitting alone; and
I rose and walked away, like one intoxicated, until I entered the
house.</p>

<p>There, on going in, I beheld my cousin 'Azeezeh with one of her
hands holding a peg knocked into the wall, and her other hand upon
her bosom; and she was groaning, and reciting verses; but when she
had finished her recitation, she turned her eyes towards me, and
beheld me; whereupon she wiped away her tears and mine with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
sleeve, and, smiling in my face, said to me, O son of my uncle, Allah
grant thee enjoyment of that which He hath given thee! Wherefore
hast thou not visited thy beloved this night?&mdash;And when I heard her
words, I kicked her with my foot upon her bosom, and she fell down
upon the raised floor, and there was a peg there, and it wounded her
forehead. On looking at her I saw that her forehead was cut open,
and her blood was flowing; yet she was silent, and uttered not a
single letter; but rose immediately, and burned some tinder of rags,
and, having closed with it the wound, tied a bandage round her head,
and wiped away the blood that had flowed upon the carpet; and it
was as though this accident had not occurred. She then came to me,
and, smiling in my face, said to me with a gentle voice, By Allah, O
son of my uncle, I said not this to make a jest of thee or of her. I
was troubled just now by the aching of my head, and with wiping
away the blood: but at the present moment the pain of my head is
alleviated, and that of my forehead: tell me therefore what hath
happened to thee this day.&mdash;So I related to her all that had befallen
me through the conduct of that damsel on this day; and after I had
done so I wept; but she said to me, Rejoice at the announcement of
the success of thy desire, and the accomplishment of thy hope. Verily
this is a sign of acceptance: for she absented herself from thee because
she desireth to try thee, and to know whether thou art patient or not,
and whether thou art sincere in thy love of her or not. To-morrow
go to her, and station thyself at thy first place, and see what sign she
will make to thee; for thy happiness is near, and thy sorrow is dissipated.&mdash;And
she proceeded to console me; but I ceased not to
increase in anxiety and grief. She then placed the food before me;
but I kicked it with my foot, and the contents of each saucer were
scattered about; and I said, Every one who is in love is insane, and
inclineth not to food, nor findeth pleasure in sleep.&mdash;By Allah, O son
of my uncle, exclaimed my cousin 'Azeezeh, these are indeed symptoms
of love! And her tears flowed, and she gathered together the fragments
of the saucers, and wiped up the food that was spilt, and sat
chatting to me, while I prayed to God that He would hasten the
morning.</p>

<p>And when the morning came, and diffused its light, I repaired to
the damsel, and entered hastily the by-street, where I seated myself
upon the ma&#7779;&#7789;abah before mentioned; and lo, the window was opened,
and she put forth her head from it, laughing. She then retired, and
returned bringing a mirror, and a bag, and a pot filled with green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
plants, and having also in her hand a lamp: and the first thing that
she did was this: she took the mirror in her hand, and put it into the
bag: then she tied it up and threw it back into the chamber. After
this, she let down her hair over her face, and put the lamp upon the
top of the green plants for a moment, and then took all these things
and departed with them, and closed the lattice. My heart was riven
by her secret signs and her obscure intimations, for she addressed me
not with a single word, and my passion grew more violent thereat, and
my excitement and distraction increased.</p>

<p>I retraced my steps with weeping eye and sorrowful heart until
I entered the house, where I saw my cousin sitting with her face to
the wall: her heart was burning with anxiety and grief and jealousy;
but her affection prevented her from acquainting me at all with the
passion which she felt on witnessing my excessive love and distraction.
I then looked at her again, and saw that she had, on her head, two
bandages: one of them was on account of the accident that had
happened to her forehead, and the other was upon her eye, on
account of a pain that she suffered in consequence of the violence of
her weeping. She was in a most miserable case, weeping, and reciting
these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherever thou be, mayst thou be in safety, O thou who departest, and yet dwellest in my heart!</span>
<span class="i0">May God be near thee wherever thou goest, to deliver thee from vicissitudes and from misfortunes!</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast gone, and mine eye is cheerless through thine absence, and my tears are flowing&mdash;O how abundantly!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when she had ended her recitation, she looked towards me and
saw me as she wept, and she wiped away her tears, and rose to me;
but she could not speak, from the excessive love with which she
was affected, and she remained for some time silent; after which, she
said to me, O son of my uncle, tell me what thou hast experienced
from her on this occasion. And I told her all that had happened to
me; whereupon she said to me, Be patient; for the time of thy union
is come, and thou hast attained the object of thy hopes. As to the
sign that she made to thee with the mirror, and her putting it into the
bag, it is equivalent to her saying to thee, Wait until the sun shall
have set:&mdash;and as to her letting fall her hair over her face, it implieth
her saying to thee, When night cometh, and letteth fall its black
shade over the light of day, come hither:&mdash;and the sign that she
made to thee with the pot containing the plants meant that she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
say to thee, When thou comest, enter the garden that is behind the
by-street:&mdash;and the sign which she made to thee with the lamp
denoted her saying to thee, When thou enterest the garden, to the
place where thou findest the lighted lamp do thou repair, and seat
thyself beneath it, and there wait for me; for the love of thee
destroyeth me.&mdash;But when I heard these words of my cousin, I cried
out from the excess of my passion, and said, How many times dost
thou promise me, and I go to her and attain not my desire, nor find
a true meaning to thine interpretation? And upon this, my cousin
laughed, and replied, It remaineth for thee to have patience during
the rest of this day, until the daylight is gone, and the night cometh
with its deep darkness, and then shalt thou enjoy thy union and the
accomplishment of thy hopes; and these words are true, without any
falsehood. She then drew near to me, and comforted me with soft
words, but dared not bring me any food, fearing that I should be
angry with her, and hoping that I might incline to her with favour:
she only came to me, and took off my outer clothes: after which she
said to me, O son of my uncle, sit with me that I may converse with
thee to amuse thee until the close of the day, and, if it be the will of
God, the night shall not come without thy being in the company of
thy beloved. But I took no notice of her, waiting for the night, and
saying, O Allah, hasten the coming of the night! And when it
arrived, my cousin wept violently, and gave me a grain of pure musk,
saying to me, O son of my uncle, put this grain in thy mouth, and
when thou hast met thy Beloved, and she hath accepted thy suit, recite
to her this verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O ye lovers, by Allah, inform me, how a youth should act when his love is intense.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>She then kissed me, and desired me to swear that I would not
recite this verse until my departure from the damsel; and I replied,
I hear and obey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 546px; position: relative;"><a name="f186" id="f186"></a><img src="images/fig186.png" width="546" height="581" alt="The Mak'ad" title="The Mak'ad" /></div>

<p>I went forth at the hour of nightfall, and proceeded until I came
to the garden. I found its gate open, and entered, and beheld a
light in the distance; so I advanced towards it, and when I arrived at
it, I found there a large ma&#7731;'ad,<a href="#VIII20" class="fnanchor">20</a> over which was constructed a dome
of ivory and ebony, and the lamp was suspended in the midst of the
dome. The ma&#7731;'ad was furnished with silken carpets embroidered
with gold and silver; and there was a great lighted candle in a
candlestick of gold beneath the lamp: in the midst of the chamber
was a fountain ornamented with various designs:<a href="#VIII21" class="fnanchor">21</a> by the side of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
fountain was a table of viands covered with a silk napkin, near which
was a large china bottle full of wine, with a cup of crystal adorned
with gilding; and by the side of all these things was a great tray of
silver, covered over. I uncovered it, and beheld in it a variety of
fruits, such as figs and pomegranates and grapes and oranges and
citrons of different kinds, together with various flowers, as roses and
jasmine and myrtle and eglantine and narcissus, and all kinds of sweet
scents. I was astonished at this place, and affected with the utmost
delight, and my anxiety and grief were dissipated; but I found not
in this abode any being of the creatures of God (whose name be
exalted!); not even a male or female slave did I see, nor the person
who thus neglected these things. I sat in this chamber, waiting for
the coming of the beloved of my heart, until the first hour of the
night had passed, and the second hour, and the third; but she came
not; and hunger began to torment me violently, for a long time had
elapsed without my eating food, through the excess of my passion;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
but when I beheld this place, and my cousin's correct understanding
of the signs made by my beloved became manifest to me, I felt at
ease; yet I still experienced the torment of hunger, and the savoury
odours of the food upon the table had excited my desire on my arrival
there. Feeling secure, therefore, of the attainment of my object, and
longing to eat, I approached the table, and took off the cover, and
found in the midst of it a dish of china containing four fricandoed
fowls seasoned with spices, around which were four saucers; one
containing sweetmeats; and another, conserve of pomegranate-grains;
and a third, ba&#7731;l&aacute;weh;<a href="#VIII22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and the fourth, &#7731;a&#7789;&aacute;&iuml;f:<a href="#VIII23" class="fnanchor">23</a> the contents of these
saucers consisting both of sweet and acid. So I ate of the &#7731;a&#7789;&aacute;&iuml;f, and
a piece of meat, and I put my hand to the ba&#7731;l&aacute;weh and ate of it as
much as was agreeable, and then turned to the sweetmeat and ate a
spoonful, or two, or three, or four, and I ate a portion of a fowl, and
a morsel of another dish: and when I had done this, my stomach was
full, and my joints became loose, and I was too lazy to remain awake;
so I laid my head upon a cushion, after I had washed my hands, and
sleep overcame me, and I knew not what happened to me after this.
I awoke not until the sun scorched me (for some days had passed
without my having tasted sleep); and when I awoke, I found upon
my stomach some salt and charcoal; and I stood up and shook my
clothes, and looked to the right and left, but found no one: I
discovered that I had been sleeping upon the marble pavement
without anything spread beneath me, and I was perplexed in my
mind, and mourned greatly; my tears ran down upon my cheeks, and
I lamented for myself.</p>

<p>I then returned to the house, and when I arrived there I found
my cousin striking her hand upon her bosom, and weeping with tears
like raining clouds; but when she beheld me she arose quickly, and
wiped away her tears, and, addressing me with her soft speech, said
to me, O son of my uncle, God hath been gracious to thee in thy
passion, since the person whom thou lovest loveth thee, while <i>I</i>
remain weeping and mourning for the separation of thee who findest
fault with me; but may God not chastise thee on my account! She
then smiled in my face with the smile of one in anger, and caressed
me, and took off my outer clothes, and spread them out, and said,
By Allah, these are not the odours of one who hath enjoyed the
company of his beloved! Tell me, then, what hath happened to
thee, O son of my uncle.&mdash;And I told her all that had befallen me;
whereupon she smiled a second time with the smile of one in anger,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
and said, Verily, my heart is full and in pain! But may the person
who paineth thy heart cease to exist! This woman maketh herself
extravagantly difficult to thee. By Allah, O son of my uncle, I fear
what she may do to thee. Know that the meaning of the salt is,
Thou art drowned in sleep, and seemest insipid, so that the soul
regardeth thee with loathing, and thou requirest to be salted, that
the stomach may not eject thee: thou pretendest that thou art of
the number of generous lovers; but sleep, unto lovers, is forbidden;
and thy pretension to love is false.&mdash;Such, however, is her pretension:
her love for thee is false, for when she saw thee sleeping she did not
rouse thee; and had her love for thee been true she would have
roused thee.&mdash;And as to the charcoal, the meaning indicated by it is,
May God blacken thy face,<a href="#VIII24" class="fnanchor">24</a> since thou hast made false pretensions to
love, when thou art only a child, and hast no care but for eating and
drinking and sleeping. This is the interpretation of her sign; and
may Allah (whose name be exalted!) deliver thee from her.&mdash;Now
when I heard what she said, I struck my hand upon my breast, and
exclaimed, By Allah, this is the truth; for I slept; and lovers sleep
not: so I have wronged mine own self. What could have been more
injurious to me than eating and sleeping? And what is to be done?&mdash;I
then wept exceedingly, and said to my cousin, Direct me what to
do, and have mercy upon me; so may God have mercy upon thee;
otherwise I shall die. My cousin, therefore, having a very great
love for me, replied, On my head and my eye! But, O son of my
uncle, I have told thee several times, that, if I had the privilege of
coming in and going out when I pleased, I would accomplish thy
union with her in the shortest time, and cover you both with my
skirt; and this I would not do but from the desire of obtaining thine
approval. If God permit, I will employ my utmost endeavours to
bring you together; but hear my words, and comply with my
directions, and go to that same place, and seat thyself there: when
the hour of nightfall is come, seat thyself in the place where thou
wast, and beware of eating anything; for eating induceth sleep: have
a care then that thou sleep not; for she will not come to thee until
a quarter of the night hath passed: and may God avert from thee
her wickedness!&mdash;So, when I heard her words, I rejoiced, and prayed
God to hasten the night; and when night came, I desired to depart;
and my cousin said to me, When thou hast met her, repeat to her the
verse before mentioned, at the time of thy departure. I replied, On
the head and the eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span></p>

<p>And when I went forth and repaired to the garden, I found the
place prepared, in the same state in which I had seen it before; in
it was everything requisite, of food and drink and dried fruits and
sweet scents and other things; and I went up into the ma&#7731;'ad,
and, smelling the odour of the food, I longed for it. I refrained
from it several times; but at length I could not withstand it: so
I arose and went to the table, and took off its cover, and found a
dish of fowls, around which were four saucers of food of four different
kinds; and I ate of each kind a morsel, and as much as was
agreeable of the sweetmeat, and a piece of meat, and drank some
zardeh,<a href="#VIII25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and, finding it pleasant to me, I drank again of it plentifully
by the spoonful until I was satiated and my stomach was full.
And after this, my eyelids closed; so I took a pillow and put it
beneath my head, saying, Perhaps I may recline upon it without
sleeping. But I closed my eyes and slept, and awoke not until the
sun had risen, when I found upon my stomach a play-bone and a
&#7789;&aacute;b-stick<a href="#VIII26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and a date-stone and a locust-seed; and there was no
furniture nor anything else in the place and it seemed as if nothing
had been there on the preceding night.</p>

<p>I rose, and shook off all these things from me, and went forth
enraged, and, arriving at the house, I found my cousin groaning;
and I chid her and abused her; whereupon she wept, and, having
wiped away her tears, approached and kissed me, and pressed me
to her bosom; but I drew back from her, blaming myself. She
then said to me, O son of my uncle, it seemeth that thou hast slept
again this last night. I replied, Yes; and when I awoke I found
a play-bone laid upon my stomach, and a &#7789;&aacute;b-stick and a date-stone
and a locust-seed; and I know not wherefore she did this. Then
I wept, and approached her, and said to her, Explain to me the
meaning of her doing this, and tell me how I shall act, and assist
me in my trouble. She replied, On the head and the eye. As to the
&#7789;&aacute;b-stick [and the play-bone], which she placed upon thy stomach,
she meaneth thereby, that thou camest there and thy heart was absent;
as though she would say to thee, Love is not thus; therefore reckon
not thyself among lovers.<a href="#VIII27" class="fnanchor">27</a> And as to the date-stone, she indicated
by it, that, if thou wert a lover, thy heart had been burning with
passion, and thou wouldst not taste the delight of sleep; for the
sweetness of love is like a date, which kindleth a fire in the heart.<a href="#VIII28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
And as to the locust-seed, she intimated to thee by it, that the heart
of the lover is fatigued; and she would say to thee thereby, Endure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
our separation with the patience of Job.<a href="#VIII29" class="fnanchor">29</a>&mdash;When I heard this
interpretation, fire darted into my heart, and my grief increased,
and I cried out and exclaimed, God had decreed that I should sleep,
on account of my little fortune! I then said to her, O daughter of
my uncle, by my life I conjure thee to contrive for me some stratagem
by means of which I may obtain an interview with her. And I
wept.&mdash;O 'Azeez, O son of my uncle, she replied, verily my heart is
full of thoughts, and I cannot talk; but go thou to-night to that
place, and beware of sleeping, and so shalt thou attain thy desire.
This is my counsel, and peace be on thee.&mdash;I said, If it please God,
I will not sleep; but I will do as thou chargest me. And my cousin
arose, and brought me food, saying to me, Eat now what will satisfy
thee, that thou mayest have no desire remaining. So I ate what
satisfied me: and when night came, my cousin arose, and brought me
a superb suit of clothing, and clad me with it, and conjured me to
repeat to the damsel the verse before mentioned, and cautioned me
against sleeping.</p>

<p>I then departed from her, and, having repaired to the garden,
went up into the ma&#7731;'ad; and I gazed at the garden, and kept
opening my eyes with my fingers, and shaking my head, as the
night grew dark. But I became hungry from watching, and the
odours of the food were wafted towards me, and my hunger in consequence
increased: so I went to the table, and removed its cover,
and ate a morsel of every dish, and a piece of meat, and I went to
the bottle of wine, saying within myself, I will drink a cup:&mdash;and
I drank it, and then drank the second, and the third, and so on to
the number of ten; and being already stricken by love, I fell upon
the floor as one slain. Thus I remained until day came, and I awoke,
and found myself outside the garden, with a large sharp knife upon
my stomach, and an iron dirhem;<a href="#VIII30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and I trembled with fear, and
took them with me and returned to the house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 578px; position: relative;"><a name="f187" id="f187"></a><img src="images/fig187.png" width="578" height="417" alt="'Azeez returned with the Knife and Dirhem" title="'Azeez returned with the Knife and Dirhem" /></div>

<p>I found my cousin saying, I am in this house wretched and
sorrowful, with no relief but weeping. And as I entered, I fell
down prostrate, throwing the knife and dirhem from my hand, and
fainted; and when I recovered, I acquainted her with that which had
befallen me, and said to her, I shall not attain my desire. Her
grief increased at witnessing my weeping and my excessive passion,
and she said to me, I have failed of success in cautioning thee against
sleeping; for thou wouldst not attend to my advice: my words profit
thee nothing. But I replied, I conjure thee by Allah that thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
explain to me the meaning of the knife and the iron dirhem. So she
said, As to the dirhem, she alluded by it to her right eye,<a href="#VIII31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and
intimated that she swore by it, and said, By the Lord of all creatures,
and by my right eye,<a href="#VIII32" class="fnanchor">32</a> if thou come again and sleep I will assuredly
slaughter thee with this knife!&mdash;I fear for thee, therefore, O son of
my uncle, from her malice; and my heart is full of grief on thine
account, and I cannot talk. If, then, thou art confident in thyself
that, if thou return to her, thou wilt not sleep, return to her, and
beware of sleeping, and so shalt thou attain thy desire; but if thou
know that, shouldst thou go to her again, thou wilt sleep as usual,
and so go to her and sleep, she will slaughter thee.&mdash;What then,
said I, is to be done, O daughter of my uncle? I conjure thee by
Allah to help me in this affliction.&mdash;She replied, On my head and
my eye: and if thou attend to my words and comply with my
directions thou wilt accomplish thy desire. I said, I will do so.
And she rejoined, When the time of departure cometh I will tell
thee. She then pressed me to her bosom, and laid me on the bed,
and continued gently kneading my limbs until slumber overcame
me, and I sank into sleep;<a href="#VIII33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and she took a fan, and, seating herself
at my head, fanned my face until the close of day, when she roused
me; and on my awaking, I found her at my head with the fan in her
hand, and weeping so that her tears had wetted her clothes. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
when she saw me that I had awoke, she wiped away her tears, and
brought me some food. I refrained from it; but she said to me, Did
I not tell thee that thou must attend to my directions? Eat, therefore.&mdash;So
I ate, and would not oppose her; and she proceeded to put
the food into my mouth, while I chewed it, until my stomach was
full. She then gave me to drink some infusion of jujubes<a href="#VIII34" class="fnanchor">34</a> with
sugar, and washed my hands, and dried them with a handkerchief,
and sprinkled some rose-water upon me; after which I sat with her,
in healthy frame; and when the night became dark, she put on me
my clothes, and said, O son of my uncle, watch all night, and sleep
not; for she will not come to thee this night until near its close; and,
if it be the will of God, thou shalt meet her this night; but forget not
my charge. Then she wept, and my heart was pained for her, on
account of her excessive weeping; and I said to her, What is the
charge which thou gavest me? She answered, When thou departest
from her, repeat to her the verse before mentioned.</p>

<p>I then went forth from her full of joy, and proceeded to the
garden, and went up to the ma&#7731;'ad, satiated with food. I remained
sleepless a quarter of the night, and the night seemed as long to
me as though it were a year; and I continued watching until two
thirds of it had passed, and the cocks crew, and I became violently
hungry from watching: so I went up to the table, and ate until I
was satisfied; and my head became heavy, and I desired to sleep;
but suddenly I heard a noise in the distance; whereupon I arose,
and washed my hands and mouth, and roused myself; and soon
after, she came. She was accompanied by ten female slaves, and
she appeared among them like the full moon among the planets:
she was attired in a garment of green satin embroidered with red
gold; and when she saw me, she laughed, and said, How is it that
thou hast remained awake, and that sleep hath not overcome thee?
Now that thou hast passed the night sleepless I am convinced that
thou art a lover; for among the characteristics of lovers is the
watching by night in the resolute endurance of desire.&mdash;She then
turned towards her female slaves, and made a sign to them; whereupon
they departed from her; and she approached me, and pressed
me to her bosom, and kissed me, and we conversed together until
the morning, when I desired to depart; but she held me, and said
to me, Stop, that I may acquaint thee with something, and give
thee a charge.&mdash;So I stopped; and she unfolded a handkerchief,
and, taking forth from it this piece of linen, spread it open before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
me; and I found in it the design of the gazelles, as thou seest, and
I admired it exceedingly, and took it; after which I made a promise
to her that I would pay her a visit every night in that garden,
and departed from her, full of joy; but in my joy I forgot the
verse which my cousin had charged me to repeat. And when she
gave me the piece of linen containing the design of the gazelles, she
said to me, This is the work of my sister.&mdash;And what, said I, is the
name of thy sister? She answered, Her name is Noor-el-Hud&agrave;:<a href="#VIII35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
and do thou take care of this piece of linen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px; position: relative;"><a name="f188" id="f188"></a><img src="images/fig188.png" width="495" height="288" alt="'Azeezeh weeping over the Design of the Gazelles" title="'Azeezeh weeping over the Design of the Gazelles" /></div>

<p>After this, when I had taken leave of her and departed, full of
joy, I returned and went in to my cousin, and found her lying
down, and when she saw me she rose, her tears dropping, and
approached me, and, kissing my bosom, said, Hast thou recited the
verse as I charged thee? I answered, I forgot it; and nothing drove
it from my mind but the design of these gazelles. And I threw down
the piece of linen before her. She arose, and then seated herself
again, and, in her impatience, shed tears, and said, O son of my
uncle, make a present to me of this piece of linen. So I gave it
her, and she took it and spread it open, and saw what was in it.
And when the time of my departure came, she said, Go, and may
safety attend thee; but when thou retirest from her, recite to her
the verse that I taught thee before, and which thou didst forget.&mdash;Repeat
it to me, said I. And she did so.</p>

<p>I then repaired to the garden, and entered the ma&#7731;'ad. I found
the damsel waiting for me, and when she beheld me she arose and
kissed me and seated me, and we ate and drank, and in the morning
I repeated to her the verse, which was this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O ye lovers, by Allah, inform me, how a youth should act when his love is intense.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>And when she heard it, her eyes filled with tears, and thus she
replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He should hide his love, and conceal his secret, and be patient under every event, and submissive.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I committed this to memory, and, glad at having done what my
cousin desired, went forth and returned to her. I found her lying
down, with my mother, at her head, weeping for her unhappy state;
and when I went in to her, my mother said to me, Perdition to such
a cousin as thou! How canst thou leave the daughter of thine
uncle indisposed and not inquire respecting her disease?&mdash;But my
cousin, on beholding me, raised her head, and sat up, and said to
me, O 'Azeez, hast thou repeated to her the verse that I taught thee?
I answered, Yes: and when she heard it, she wept, and recited to
me another verse, which I retain in my memory.&mdash;Let me hear it,
said my cousin. And when I had repeated it to her she wept
violently, and recited this other verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He hath sought to attain a becoming patience; but found nought save a heart pining with desire.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>She then said to me, When thou goest to her as usual, repeat to her
this verse which thou hast heard. I replied, I hear and obey.</p>

<p>So I went to the garden according to my custom, and when I was
about to return, I recited to the damsel that verse; and when she
heard it, tears poured from her eyes, and she replied,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, if he have not patience to conceal his secret, I know nothing better for him than death.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Retaining this in my memory, I returned to the house; and
when I went in to my cousin, I found her fallen down in a fit, and
my mother sitting at her head; and when my cousin heard my
voice, she opened her eyes, and said, O 'Azeez, hast thou repeated
to her the verse? I answered, Yes: and when she heard it, she
wept, and recited to me this other verse. And I repeated it to her;
and as soon as she heard it she fainted again, and, on her recovering,
recited another verse, which was this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We hear and obey, and we die; then convey my salutation to the person who hath prevented our union.<a href="#VIII36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the approach of the following night I went again to the
garden as usual, and found the damsel expecting me; and we ate and
drank; and in the morning, when I was about to depart, I repeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
to her what my cousin had said; whereupon she uttered a loud cry,
and was agitated, and exclaimed, By Allah, she who uttered this
verse hath died! She then wept, and said to me, Wo to thee! Is
not she who uttered this verse related to thee?&mdash;I answered, She
is the daughter of my paternal uncle.&mdash;Thou liest, replied she: by
Allah, if she were the daughter of thy uncle thou hadst borne her
the same love that she bore thee. Thou art he who hath destroyed
her, and may God destroy thee in like manner! By Allah, if thou
hadst told me of thy having a cousin, I had not admitted thee into
my favour.&mdash;Verily, said I, she is my cousin, and she explained to
me the signs that thou madest me, and it was she who taught me
how to proceed with thee: I had not obtained access to thee but
through her good management.&mdash;And did she know of our affair?
said she. I answered, Yes.&mdash;May Allah, she exclaimed, cause thee
to bewail thy youth, as thou hast caused her to bewail hers! She
then said to me, Go and see her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px; position: relative;"><a name="f189" id="f189"></a><img src="images/fig189.png" width="460" height="193" alt="'Azeezeh dead" title="'Azeezeh dead" /></div>

<p>I departed, therefore, troubled in mind, and proceeded until I
came to our street, when I heard a wailing, and, asking respecting
it, was answered, We found 'Azeezeh lying behind the door, dead.
I entered the house, and when my mother beheld me, she exclaimed,
The crime of destroying her is on thy neck, and may God not
pardon thee her blood! Perdition to such a cousin as thou!&mdash;My
father then came, and we prepared her body for interment, and
performed the funeral-ceremonies, and buried her; and we caused
recitations of the whole of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n to be performed at her tomb,
and remained there three days, after which I returned to the house,
sorrowing for her. And my mother addressed me, and said, I desire
to know what thou didst to her, so that thou brokest her heart.
I asked her continually, O my son, respecting the cause of her
disorder; but she would not acquaint me with it. I conjure thee,
therefore, by Allah, that thou inform me what thou didst unto her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
to cause her death.&mdash;I replied, I did nothing. But she said, May
God avenge her upon thee! for she mentioned to me nothing, but
concealed the truth of her case until she died, still preserving her
affection for thee; and when she died I was with her, and she opened
her eyes, and said to me, O wife of my uncle, may God hold thy son
guiltless of my blood, and not punish him for that which he hath
done unto me; and now God transporteth me from the perishable
world to the world of eternity. And I replied, O my daughter, may
God preserve thee, and preserve thy youth! And I asked her
respecting the cause of her disorder: but she answered not. Then
she smiled, and said, O wife of my uncle, if thy son desire to go to
the place which he is accustomed to frequent, tell him to repeat these
two phrases on departing from it:&mdash;Fidelity is good, and treachery is
base:&mdash;and this I desire in my compassion for him, that I may shew
him compassion in my life and after my death. She then gave me
something for thee, and took an oath of me that I would not give
it to thee until I should see thee weeping for her and lamenting:
this thing I have, and when I see thee in the state that she hath
described I will give it to thee.&mdash;I said to her, Shew it me. But she
would not.</p>

<p>I then gave myself up to my pleasures, and thought not of the
death of my cousin; for I was unsettled in mind, and wished that
I were passing the whole of every night and day with my beloved;
and scarcely had the next night approached when I repaired again
to the garden. I found the damsel sitting there, burning with
impatience to see me; and as soon as she beheld me, she hastened
to me and clung to my neck, and asked me respecting my cousin.
I answered her, She is dead, and we have performed zikrs<a href="#VIII37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and
recitations of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n for her, and four nights have passed since
her death, and this is the fifth. When she heard this, she cried out
and wept, and said, Did I not tell thee that thou hadst killed her?
Hadst thou informed me of her, before her death, I had requited
her for the kindness that she hath shewn me; for she hath been of
service to me in giving thee access to me: had it not been for her,
I should not have had an interview with thee, and I fear thou wilt fall
into a calamity on account of her disaster.&mdash;I replied, She acquitted
me before her death. And I related to her what my mother
had told me; upon which she exclaimed, By Allah, I conjure thee,
when thou goest to thy mother, learn what it is that she hath.&mdash;My
mother, said I, told me, Thy cousin, before she died, charged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
me saying, If thy son desire to go to the place which he is accustomed
to frequent, tell him to repeat these two phrases:&mdash;Fidelity
is good, and treachery is base.&mdash;And when the damsel heard this,
she exclaimed, The mercy of God (whose name be exalted!) be
upon her, for she hath saved thee from me: I was meditating an
injury to thee; but now I will not hurt thee nor trouble thee. And
I wondered at this, and said to her, What didst thou purpose before
this to do to me, after mutual love had taken place between us?
She answered, Thou art devoted to me; but thou art young, and
thy mind is free from deceit, and thou knowest not our malice nor
our deceit: were she still in the bonds of life, she would assist thee;
for she is the cause of thy safety, and hath delivered thee from
destruction: and now I charge thee that thou speak not with any
female, nor answer any of our sex, young or old. Beware, beware;
for thou art ignorant of the deceit of women, and their malice: she
who used to interpret the signs to thee is dead; and I fear for thee
lest thou fall into a calamity and find none to deliver thee from it
after the death of thy cousin. O my sorrow for the daughter of
thy uncle! Would that I had known her before her death, that I
might have requited her for the kindness that she hath done me!
The mercy of God (whose name be exalted!) be upon her, for she
concealed her secret, and revealed not what she felt; and but for
her, thou wouldst never have had access to me. And now I have a
service to demand of thee.&mdash;What is it? said I. She answered,
That thou conduct me to her tomb, that I may visit her at her grave,
and inscribe some verses upon it. I replied, To-morrow, if it be the
will of God, whose name be exalted!&mdash;So I remained with her that
night, and frequently she said to me, Would that thou hadst told me
of thy cousin before her death! And I asked her, What is the
meaning of these words which she said&mdash;Fidelity is good, and treachery
is base? But she answered me not.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 503px; position: relative;"><a name="f190" id="f190"></a><img src="images/fig190.png" width="503" height="567" alt="'Azeez and his Mistress at the Grave of 'Azeezeh" title="'Azeez and his Mistress at the Grave of 'Azeezeh" /></div>

<p>In the morning, therefore, she arose, and, taking a purse containing
some pieces of gold, said to me, Arise, and shew me the
tomb, that I may visit it, and write upon it some verses, and build
over it a cupola, and pray for mercy upon her, and bestow these
pieces of gold in alms for her soul. I replied, I hear and obey.
And I walked before her, and she followed me, and employed herself
in giving alms on the way as she went, and every time that she
did so she said, This is an alms for the soul of 'Azeezeh, who concealed
her secret until she drank the cup of death, and revealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
not her love. Thus she continued to give of the contents of the
purse, and to say, For the soul of 'Azeezeh,&mdash;until we arrived at
the tomb, and the contents of the purse were exhausted; and when
she beheld the tomb, she threw herself upon it, and wept violently.
She then took forth a pointed instrument of steel, and a small mallet,
and engraved upon the stone at the head of the tomb, in small
characters, these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I passed by an undistinguished tomb in the midst of a garden, with seven anemones upon it;<a href="#VIII38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>
<span class="i0">And I said, Whose tomb is this? The soil answered, Be respectful, for this is the resting-place of a lover.</span>
<span class="i0">So I said, God keep thee, O victim of love, and lodge thee in the highest stage of Paradise!</span>
<span class="i0">How miserable are lovers among the creation, when even their tombs are covered with vile dust!</span>
<span class="i0">Were I able [O tomb], I would make of thee a garden, and water it with my streaming tears!</span>

She then again wept violently, and arose, and I arose with her;
and after we had returned to the garden, she said to me, I conjure
thee by Allah that thou never forsake me. And I replied, I hear
and obey. So I resumed my visits to her as before, and she treated
me with kindness and honour, and used to ask me respecting the two
phrases which my cousin 'Azeezeh had mentioned to my mother,
and I repeated them to her. Thus I remained, eating and drinking,
and enjoying her conversation, and attiring myself in changes of
delicate clothing, until I became stout and fat, and I experienced
neither anxiety nor grief nor sorrow, and forgot my cousin.</p>

<p>I continued drowned in these pleasures for a whole year; and
at the commencement of the new year, I entered the bath, and
refreshed myself, and put on a handsome suit; and after I had
gone forth from the bath, I drank a cup of wine, and smelt the
odours of my clothes, which were richly perfumed with various
scents. My heart was unoppressed by calamities or misfortunes;
and when the hour of nightfall came, I desired to repair to the
damsel; but I was intoxicated, and knew not my way; and, in
going to her, intoxication led me aside into a by-street called the
street of the Na&#7731;eeb:<a href="#VIII39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and as I was proceeding along it, lo, an old
woman came, with a lighted candle in one of her hands, and in her
other hand a folded letter. I advanced towards her, and she, with
weeping eye, said to me, O my son, art thou able to read? I answered
her, Yes, my old aunt. And she said, Take this letter,
and read it to me. And she handed me the letter; so I took it
from her and opened it, and read to her its contents, informing her
that it was a letter from the absent, with salutations to the beloved.
And when she heard this, she rejoiced at the good news, and ejaculated
a prayer for me, saying, May God dispel thine anxiety as
thou hast dispelled mine! She then took the letter, and proceeded
a few steps; but presently she returned to me, and, kissing my
hand, said, O my lord, may God (whose name be exalted!) give
thee enjoyment of thy youth, and not disgrace thee. I beg that thou
wilt walk with me a few paces, to that door; for I have told them
what thou hast read to me of the letter, and they do not believe me:
come with me, therefore, two steps, and read to them the letter outside
the door, and accept my prayer for thee.&mdash;And what, said I, is
the history of this letter? She answered, O my son, this letter hath
come from my son, who hath been absent from us for the space of
ten years; for he journeyed with merchandise, and hath remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
abroad during that period, and we relinquished all hope of his return,
thinking that he was dead: then came to us this letter from him; and
he hath a sister who hath wept for him during his absence night and
day; and I told her that he was in health and prosperity; but she
believed me not, and said to me, Thou must bring me a person to
read this letter and to acquaint me with its contents, that my heart
may be set at ease and my mind comforted.&mdash;Thou knowest, O my
son, that the loving is prepossessed with evil anticipations: favour
me, therefore, by reading this letter while thou shalt stand outside
the curtain, and his sister shall hear it within the door, that the
recompense of him who accomplisheth a want for a Muslim, and
dispelleth from his mind a trouble, may be thine: for the Apostle
of God (may God bless and save him!) hath said, Whoso dispelleth
from the mind of a sorrowful person one of the troubles of this world,
God will dispel from his mind one of the troubles of the world to
come:&mdash;and in another tradition, Whoso dispelleth from the mind of
his brother one of the troubles of this world, God will dispel from his
mind seventy-two of the troubles of the day of resurrection:&mdash;and
now I have desired thee, do not disappoint me.&mdash;So I replied, I hear
and obey: proceed before me.</p>

<p>She therefore walked before me, and I followed her a little
way, until she arrived at a great door overlaid with copper; and
she stopped at this door, and called out in Persian, and immediately
a damsel approached, with light and nimble step. Her trousers
were tucked up to her knees, and I beheld a pair of legs that confounded
the mind and the eye by their beauty: they were like two
columns of alabaster, and ornamented with anklets of gold set with
jewels. The skirts of her outer clothes were tucked up under her
arms, and her sleeves were turned up from her arms, and I looked
at her white wrists, and upon them were two pairs of bracelets: in
her ears were two ear-rings of pearls; and upon her neck was a
necklace of costly jewels; and on her head, a koofeeyeh,<a href="#VIII40" class="fnanchor">40</a> quite
new, adorned with precious gems. She had tucked the skirt of
her inner tunic within the band of her trousers, and appeared as
though she had been employed in some active work. And when
she beheld me, she said, with an eloquent and sweet tongue that
I had never heard surpassed in sweetness, O my mother, is this he
who hath come to read the letter? She answered, Yes. And the
damsel stretched forth her hand to me with the letter. There was,
between her and the door, a distance of about half a rod;<a href="#VIII41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
extended my hand to take the letter from her, and put my head
and shoulders within the door to draw near to her; but before
I knew what she was about to do, the old woman placed her head
against my back, and pushed me forward, while my hand was
holding the letter, and I looked around, and found myself in the
midst of the house; that is, within the vestibule. The old woman
entered more quickly than the blinding lightning, and had nothing
to do but to shut the door: and when the damsel beheld me within
the vestibule, she approached me, and pressed me to her bosom,
and, taking me by the hand, unable to extricate myself from her
grasp, led me, preceded by the old woman with the lighted candle,
until she had passed through seven vestibules; after which she conducted
me into a large saloon, with four leew&aacute;ns,<a href="#VIII42" class="fnanchor">42</a> in which a
horseman might play at goff.<a href="#VIII43" class="fnanchor">43</a> She then seated me, and said to me,
Open thine eye. And I did so, giddy from the violence that I had
experienced, and saw that the whole construction of the saloon was
of the most beautiful alabaster, and all its furniture, including the
cushions and mattresses, of brocade. In it were also two benches of
brass, and a couch of red gold set with pearls and jewels, not suitable
to any but a King like thee.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 270px; position: relative;"><a name="f191" id="f191"></a><img src="images/fig191.png" width="270" height="432" alt="The future Wife of 'Azeez" title="The future Wife of 'Azeez" /></div>

<p>After this, she said to me, O 'Azeez, which of the two states is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
the more agreeable to thee, life or death? I answered her, Life.
And she said, Then if life is more agreeable to thee, marry me.&mdash;I
dislike, I replied, marrying such a person as thou. She rejoined,
if thou marry me, thou wilt be secure from the daughter of the crafty
Deleeleh.<a href="#VIII44" class="fnanchor">44</a>&mdash;And who, said I, is the daughter of the crafty Deleeleh?
She laughed, and answered, How is it that thou knowest her not,
when thou hast now been in her company a year and four months?
May Allah (whose name be exalted!) destroy her. Verily there
existeth not any one more treacherous than she. How many persons
hath she killed before thee, and what deeds hath she done! And
how hast thou escaped from her, without her killing or troubling
thee, when thou hast been in her company all this time?&mdash;When I
heard her words I wondered extremely, and said to her, O my
mistress, who acquainted thee with her? She answered, I know her
as the age knoweth its calamities; but I desire that thou inform me
of all that thou hast experienced from her, that I may know the
cause of thy safety from her. So I related to her all that had
happened to me with her and with my cousin 'Azeezeh; and she
exclaimed, Allah have mercy upon her!&mdash;and her eyes shed tears,
and she struck her hands together, when she heard of the death of
my cousin 'Azeezeh, and said, May Allah compensate thee abundantly
for the loss of her, O 'Azeez; for she hath been the cause of thy
safety from the daughter of the crafty Deleeleh; and had it not been
for her, thou hadst perished.<a href="#VIII45" class="fnanchor">45</a> After this, she clapped her hands, and
said, O my mother, bring in those who are with thee. And lo, the
old woman approached with four lawful witnesses; and she lighted
four candles; and when the witnesses entered, they saluted me, and
seated themselves; and the damsel covered herself with an iz&aacute;r, and
appointed one of the witnesses to be her deputy in making her
contract. So they performed the marriage-contract, and she affirmed
of herself that she had received the whole of the dowry, both the
portion usually paid in advance and the arrears, and that she was
indebted to me in the sum of ten thousand pieces of silver; after
which she gave to the witnesses their fees, and they departed.</p>

<p>On the following day, I desired to go out; but she approached
me laughing, and said, Dost thou think that going out from the
bath is like entering it?<a href="#VIII46" class="fnanchor">46</a> I imagine thou thinkest me to be like
the daughter of the crafty Deleeleh. Beware of entertaining such
an idea. Thou art no other than my husband, according to the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n and the Sunneh; and if thou hast been intoxicated, return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
to thy reason. Verily this house in which thou art is not opened
but on one day in every year. Go to the street-door and look.&mdash;So
I went and looked, and found it closed and nailed, and returned
and told her so; and she said to me, O 'Azeez, we have of flour
and grain and fruits and pomegranates and sugar and meat and
sheep and fowls and other provisions what will suffice us for many
years, and from this last night our door will not be opened until
after a year and I know that thou wilt not behold thyself outside
this house until after a year hath expired. Upon this I exclaimed,
There is no strength nor power but in God! And she laughed,
and I laughed also, and complied with her orders, and remained
with her until the twelve months of the year had expired, when I
was blest with a son by her. And on the first day of the following
year, I heard the opening of the door, and lo, men came in with
ka&#7841;ks<a href="#VIII47" class="fnanchor">47</a> and flour and sugar; and I desired to go out; but she said
to me, Wait until nightfall, and as thou camest in, so go forth. I
therefore waited until that hour, and was on the point of going out,
in fear and trembling, when she said to me, By Allah, I will not let
thee go until I have made thee swear to me that thou wilt return this
night before the door is closed. So I promised her to do it; and she
made me swear by binding oaths upon the sword and the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and
by the oath of divorce, that I would return to her.<a href="#VIII48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>I then went forth from her, and repaired to the garden. I found
it open as usual, and was angry, saying within myself, I have been
absent from this place a whole year, and, coming unawares, have
found it open as usual. I wonder if the damsel be still there as
heretofore, and I must enter and see before I go to my mother.&mdash;It
was then nightfall, and I entered the garden, and, proceeding to
the ma&#7731;'ad, found the daughter of the crafty Deleeleh sitting with
her head upon her knee and her hand upon her cheek. Her complexion
was changed, and her eyes were sunk, and when she beheld
me she exclaimed, Praise be to God for thy safety!&mdash;and she
endeavoured to rise, but fell down through her joy. I was ashamed
at seeing her, and hung down my head; but presently I advanced
to her and kissed her, and said to her, How didst thou know that
I was coming to thee at this time? She answered, I knew it not.
By Allah, for a year I have not tasted sleep; but have sat up every
night expecting thee, and in this state have I been from the day
when thou wentest forth from me and I gave thee the new suit of
clothing and thou promisedst me that thou wouldst return to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
I remained expecting thee, and thou camest not the first night, nor
the second, nor the third: so I still waited in expectation of thy
coming; for such is the way of the lover: and I would now that
thou tell me what hath been the cause of thine absence from me
this year. I therefore told her; and when she knew that I had
married, her countenance became pale. I then said to her, I have
come to thee this night, but must go before the morning. But she
exclaimed, Is it not enough for her to have married thee, and to
have employed this stratagem against thee, and imprisoned thee
with her a whole year, that she hath made thee swear by the oath
of divorce that thou wilt return to her before the morning, and
will not allow thee to divert thyself with thy mother nor with me,
and cannot endure thy passing one night with either of us? What
then must be the state of her from whom thou hast been absent a
whole year, though I knew thee before she did! But may Allah
have mercy on 'Azeezeh; for she suffered what none other hath
suffered, and endured with patience that of which none else hath
endured the like, and died through thy oppression. It was she
who protected thee from me. I thought that thou wouldst return,
and gave thee liberty, though I was able to imprison thee, and to
destroy thee.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px; position: relative;"><a name="f192" id="f192"></a><img src="images/fig192.png" width="506" height="291" alt="The Punishment of 'Azeez" title="The Punishment of 'Azeez" /></div>

<p>Having thus said, she wept, and became enraged, and looked at
me with the eye of anger; and when I beheld her in this state, the
muscles of my side quivered, and I feared her, and became as the
bean upon the fire. She then cried out, and suddenly ten female
slaves came to me, and threw me upon the floor; and when I fell
under their hands, she arose, and, taking a knife, said, I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
slaughter thee as goats are slaughtered, and this shall be thy least
recompense for that which thou hast done unto thy Cousin. When
I beheld myself, therefore, beneath her female slaves, and my cheek
was soiled with the dust, and I saw the knife in her hand, I looked
upon death as inevitable. I implored her mercy; but she only
increased in hardness, and ordered the female slaves to bind my
hands behind me; and they did so, and, throwing me upon my
back, seated themselves upon my body, and held my head. Then
two of them arose and took hold of my toes, and two others seated
themselves upon my legs; after which, their mistress arose, with
two others of them, and she ordered them to beat me; whereupon
they beat me until I fainted, and my voice became inaudible; and
when I recovered, I said within myself, Verily my being slaughtered
were easier to me than this beating! I bethought myself of the
words of my cousin, when she said, May God avert from thee her
wickedness!&mdash;and I cried out and wept until my voice failed. She
then sharpened the knife, and said to the female slaves, Uncover his
throat. But God inspired me to repeat the two phrases which my
cousin had charged me to utter, namely, Fidelity is good, and
treachery is base;&mdash;and when she heard this, she cried out and
said, Allah have mercy upon thee, O 'Azeezeh! Would that thy
youth had been spared! Thou hast profited thy cousin during
thy life and after thy death!&mdash;Then addressing me, she added, By
Allah, thou hast saved thy life from me by means of these two
phrases; but I must cause thee to bear a mark of my resentment.&mdash;So
saying, she inflicted upon me a cruel wound, and I fainted; but
when I recovered, the blood had stopped, and she gave me to drink a
cup of wine, and spurned me with her foot.</p>

<p>I rose; but was unable at first to walk: presently, however, I
proceeded by little and little until I arrived at the door of my wife's
house. I found it open, and threw myself within it, in a state of
distraction; and my wife came and took me up and conveyed me to
the saloon, where I fell into a deep sleep; but when I awoke, I
found myself laid at the gate of the garden.</p>

<p>In anguish I rose, and went to my home, and, entering the
house, found my mother weeping for me, and exclaiming, Would
that I knew, O my son, in what land thou art! So I approached
her, and threw myself upon her, and when she beheld me, she saw
that I was unwell. Yellowness and blackness were mingled upon
my face; and I remembered my cousin, and the kindness she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
shewn me, and was convinced that she loved me. I wept for her,
and my mother also wept, and then said to me, O my son, thy father
is dead. And upon this, my rage increased, and I wept until I
became insensible; and when I recovered, I looked towards the place
where my cousin was accustomed to sit, and wept again till I fainted
from the violence of my lamentation. I ceased not to weep and wail
until midnight, when my mother said to me, Thy father hath been
dead ten days. But I replied, I think of no one but my cousin; for
I deserve what hath happened to me, because I neglected her when
she loved me. She asked me, therefore, And what hath happened
to thee? So I related to her that which had befallen me; to which
she replied, Praise be to God that this happened to thee and that she
did not slaughter thee! She then applied remedies to my wound
until I recovered, and regained my usual strength; and she said to
me, O my son, I will now produce to thee the deposite with which thy
cousin intrusted me; for it is thine, and she made me swear that I
would not produce it to thee until I saw that thou rememberedst her
and mournedst for her, and that thine affections for another were
severed; and now I hope that I find in thee these dispositions. She
therefore arose, and, opening a chest, took forth from it this piece of
linen containing the design of the gazelles, which I had originally
given to her; and when I took it, I found written upon it some
verses complaining of her unrequited love for me, and there fell from
it a paper containing some words of consolation and counsel.<a href="#VIII49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>As soon as I had read and understood this paper, I wept again,
and my mother did the same, and I continued looking at it and
weeping until the approach of night; and in this state I remained for
the space of a year; after which, some merchants of my city, the same
whom I am accompanying in this caravan, prepared for a journey;
and my mother suggested to me that I should fit myself out and go
with them, saying to me, Perhaps the journey will dispel this sorrow
which thou sufferest, and thou wilt be absent a year, or two years,
or three, until the caravan returneth, and thy heart may become
dilated. Thus she continued to persuade me, so that I prepared
some merchandise, and journeyed with them; but my tears have not
dried up during my travels; for at every station where we halt
I spread this piece of linen before me, and look at this design, and
think of my cousin, and weep for her as thou seest, since she loved
me excessively, and died through my unkindness; I doing nothing
but evil to her, while she did nothing to me but what was good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
When the merchants return from their journey, I shall return with
them, and the period of my absence will be a complete year; but I
still suffer increasing sorrow; and my sorrow hath been only augmented
in consequence of my passing by the Islands of Camphor and
the Castle of Crystal.<a href="#VIII50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>These Islands are seven in number, and the sovereign of them is
a King named Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n.<a href="#VIII51" class="fnanchor">51</a> He hath a daughter named Duny&agrave;;<a href="#VIII52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
and it was told me that it was she who worked the designs of the
gazelles, and that this design which is in my possession was one of
her work; and when I knew this, I became excessively desirous of
seeing her: so, when the caravan entered her country, I went forth
and wandered about the gardens, which contained a profusion of trees.
The superintendent of the gardens was a sheykh advanced in age; and
I said to him, O sheykh, to whom doth this garden belong? He
answered, To the King's daughter, the lady Duny&agrave;, and we are
beneath her palace; and if thou desire to amuse thyself, open the
private door, and take a view of the garden and smell the odours of
the flowers. So I said to him, Have the kindness to allow me to sit
in this garden until she passeth by, that I may enjoy a glance at her.
The sheykh replied, There will be no harm in thy doing so. When
he said this, therefore, I gave him some money, saying to him, Buy
for us something to eat. And he rejoiced at receiving the money,
and, opening the door, conducted me within; and we proceeded until
we came to a pleasant spot, where he brought me some delicate fruits,
and said to me, Sit here while I go and return to thee. And he left
me and departed, and, after he had been absent a while, returned
bringing a roasted lamb; and we ate until we were satisfied, my heart
longing to behold the lady, and while we were sitting, lo, the door
opened; whereupon he said to me, Rise, and conceal thyself. So I
rose, and hid myself; and a black eunuch put forth his head from the
door, and said, O sheykh, is any one with thee? He answered, No.&mdash;Then
close the door, said the eunuch. The sheykh, therefore,
closed the door of the garden; and lo, the lady Duny&agrave; came forth.
When I beheld her, I thought that the moon had descended upon the
earth; my mind was confounded, and I desired her as the thirsty
longeth for water; and after a while, she closed the door and departed.
I then went forth from the garden, and repaired to my lodging,
knowing that I could not obtain access to her; and when my companions
prepared for departure, I also prepared myself, and travelled
with them towards thy city; and on our arrival here, we met with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
thee.&mdash;This is my story, and this is what hath happened unto me;
and peace be on thee.</p>
<hr />
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px; position: relative;"><a name="f193" id="f193"></a><img src="images/fig193.png" width="509" height="564" alt="The Lady Duny&agrave;" title="The Lady Duny&agrave;" /></div>

<h5>CONTINUATION OF THE STORY OF T&Aacute;J-EL-MULOOK AND THE
LADY DUNY&Agrave;.</h5>

<p>When T&aacute;j-el-Mulook heard this story, his heart became troubled
with love for the lady Duny&agrave;. He then mounted his horse, and,
taking with him 'Azeez, returned to his father's city, where he
assigned to him a house, and furnished it with everything that he
required; after which he left him, and repaired to his palace. His
tears ran down upon his cheeks (for hearing affecteth as sight and
union), and in this state he remained until his father came in to him,
and, finding that his colour was changed, knew that he was oppressed
by anxiety and grief: so he said to him, O my son, acquaint me with
thy case, and tell me what hath happened to thee to change thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
colour. He therefore related to him all that he had heard of the story
of Duny&agrave;, and how he had fallen in love with her from hearsay,
without having seen her; whereupon his father said to him, O my son,
her father is a King, and his country is distant from us: abandon,
therefore, this idea, and enter the palace of thy mother; for in it are
five hundred female slaves like so many moons, and whoever of them
pleaseth thee do thou take her; or, if none of them please thee, we will
demand in marriage for thee one of the daughters of the Kings, more
beautiful than the lady Duny&agrave;. But he replied, O my father, I
desire not any but her: it was she who worked the design of the
gazelles that I saw, and I must have her, or I will flee into the deserts,
and kill myself on her account.</p>

<p>So his father said, Have patience with me, O my son, that I may
send to her father and demand her of him in marriage, and accomplish
for thee thy wish, like as I did for myself in the case of thy mother;
and if he consent not, I will convulse his kingdom around him, and
send against him an army of which the rear shall be with me when
the van is with him. He then called for the young man 'Azeez, and
said to him, O my son, knowest thou the way? He answered, Yes.&mdash;Then
I desire of thee, said the King, that thou journey with my
Wezeer. And 'Azeez replied, I hear and obey, O King of the age.
The King, therefore, summoned his Wezeer, and said to him, Manage
for me the affair of my son according to thy knowledge, and repair to
the Islands of Camphor, and demand in marriage the daughter of
their King. He replied, I hear and obey. And T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
returned to his apartments, and his malady and impatience increased:
he fell down in a swoon, and recovered not until the morning; and
when the morning arrived, his father came to him, and saw his
complexion more changed, and his sallowness increased; and he
exhorted him to patience, and promised him the accomplishment of
his union.</p>

<p>The King then equipped 'Azeez, with his Wezeer, and supplied
them with the presents; and they journeyed days and nights until
they beheld the Islands of Camphor, when they halted on the bank
of  a river, and the Wezeer sent forward a messenger from his party
to the King, to acquaint him with their approach; and half a day
after the departure of the messenger, suddenly they saw that the
chamberlains of the King, and his emeers, had advanced to meet
them from the distance of a league; and they met him, and attended
them until they went in with them to the King. They placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
before the King the presents, and remained in his palace four days;
and on the fifth day the Wezeer arose and went in to the King, and,
standing before him, delivered to him his message, and acquainted
him with the cause of his coming; but the King was perplexed how
to answer, for his daughter liked not marriage; and he hung down
his head for a while towards the floor; and after this he raised it, and,
looking towards one of the eunuchs, said to him, Go to thy mistress
Duny&agrave;, and acquaint her with what thou hast heard, and with the
purpose of the visit of this Wezeer. So the eunuch went, and, after a
short absence, returned to the King, and said to him, O King of the
age, when I went in to the lady Duny&agrave;, and acquainted her with
what I had heard, she was violently enraged, and rose against me
with a stick, and would have broken my head; wherefore I fled from
her; and she said to me, If my father force me to marry, him whom
I marry I will kill. Her father, therefore, said to the Wezeer and
'Azeez, Salute ye the King, and inform him of this, and that my
daughter liketh not marriage. Accordingly the Wezeer returned with
his attendants unsuccessful, and they continued their journey until
they went in unto the King, and acquainted him with what had
happened; and upon this he ordered the chiefs to call together the
troops that they might march to war; but the Wezeer said to him, Do
not this; for the King is not in fault: the refusal is on the part of
his daughter, who, when she knew of this proposal, sent to say, If my
father force me to marry, I will kill him whom I marry, and kill
myself after him.</p>

<p>And when the King heard the words of the Wezeer, he feared
for his son T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, and said, If I make war upon her father,
and obtain possession of his daughter, she will kill herself. He then
acquainted his son T&aacute;j-el-Mulook with the truth of the case; and
when the prince heard it, he said to his father, O my father, I cannot
exist without her: I will therefore go to her, and seek means of
obtaining an interview with her, though I die in the attempt: and I
will do nothing but this. His father said, How wilt thou go to her?
He answered, I will go in the disguise of a merchant.&mdash;Then if it
must be so, rejoined the King, take with thee the Wezeer and 'Azeez.
He then took forth for him some money from his treasuries, and
prepared for him merchandise at the price of a hundred thousand
pieces of gold, and they both agreed as to this course; and when
night came, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and 'Azeez went to the abode of the latter,
and there passed that night. But the heart of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
captivated, and neither eating nor rest pleased him: reflections overwhelmed
him, and he was drowned in them; and, longing for his
beloved, he poured forth his tears, and wept violently; and 'Azeez
wept with him, reflecting upon his cousin; and they both continued
thus until the morning, when T&aacute;j-el-Mulook arose and went in to
his mother. He was equipped for the journey; and she asked him
respecting his state: so he acquainted her with the whole truth; and
she gave him fifty thousand pieces of gold, and bade him farewell, and
he went forth from her, while she offered up prayers for his safety,
and for his union with the object of his love. He then went in to
his father, and asked his permission to depart; and the King granted
him permission, and gave him fifty thousand pieces of gold, and
ordered that a tent should be pitched for him outside the city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px; position: relative;"><a name="f194" id="f194"></a><img src="images/fig194.png" width="478" height="466" alt="Halt on the Journey" title="Halt on the Journey" /></div>

<p>A large tent was therefore pitched for him; and after they had
remained in it two days, they commenced their journey; and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
treated 'Azeez with familiar kindness, and said to him, O my
brother, I cannot henceforth part with thee.&mdash;And I, replied 'Azeez,
am of the like mind, and desire to die at thy feet; but, O my brother,
my heart is troubled with thoughts of my mother. So T&aacute;j-el-Mulook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
said, When we shall have attained our wish, all will be well. Now
the Wezeer had charged T&aacute;j-el-Mulook to display an air of patience,
and 'Azeez occupied himself with reciting to him verses, and narrating
to him histories and tales; and they continued on their way by night
and day for the space of two months. The length of the journey
became wearisome to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook; and the violence of his desire,
and his passion and distraction, increased: so when they drew
near to the city, he rejoiced excessively, and his anxiety and grief
ceased.</p>

<p>They entered it in the garb of merchants, the King's son being
also clad in the same manner, and, coming to a place known as the
abode of merchants, which was a large Kh&aacute;n, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook said to
'Azeez, Is this the abode of the merchants? 'Azeez answered, Yes:
it is not, however, the Kh&aacute;n in which I lodged with the caravan that
I accompanied; but it is better than that. So they made their camels
lie down, and unloaded, and, having deposited their goods in the
magazines, remained there to take rest four days. The Wezeer then
suggested to them that they should hire for themselves a large house;
to which they assented; and they hired a spacious house, fitted for
festivities. There they took up their abode; and the Wezeer and
'Azeez studied to devise some stratagem for the sake of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook,
who was perplexed, not knowing what to do. The Wezeer
could contrive no other plan than that of his opening for himself a
shop to carry on the trade of a merchant in the market of fine stuffs:
he therefore addressed T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and 'Azeez, and said to them,
Know that if we remain in this state we shall not attain our wish;
and a thing hath occurred to my mind which probably may be advisable,
if it be the will of God. So they replied, Do what seemeth fit
to thee; for a blessing attendeth the aged, and especially in thy case,
since thou hast devoted thyself to the management of affairs: therefore
give us the advice which hath suggested itself to thy mind. And
he said to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, It is my opinion that we should hire for
thee a shop in the market of fine stuffs, and that thou shouldst sit in
it to sell and buy; for every person of the higher ranks and of the
people in general standeth in need of such stuffs, and if thou sit in
that shop thy affair will be arranged, if it be the will of God (whose
name be exalted!), especially because of thy comely person; but
make 'Azeez thy trusty attendant, and seat him in the shop to hand
to thee the stuffs. And when T&aacute;j-el-Mulook heard these words, he
said. This is a judicious opinion;&mdash;and immediately he took forth a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
suit of merchant's attire, and clad himself in it, and arose and went
forth, followed by his young men, and gave to one of them a thousand
pieces of gold to fit up the shop.</p>

<p>They proceeded until they arrived at the market of fine stuffs,
and when the merchants saw T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, and observed his
handsome and comely person, they were confounded, and began to
say, Hath Ri&#7693;w&aacute;n<a href="#VIII53" class="fnanchor">53</a> opened the gates of Paradise and neglected them,
so that this youth of surprising beauty hath come forth?&mdash;and one
said, This is probably one of the angels. And when they went in
among the merchants, they inquired for the shop of the Sheykh of the
market. The merchants, therefore, guided them thither, and they
went to him; and as they approached him, he and the merchants who
were with him rose to them, and received them with honour, especially
the excellent Wezeer; for they saw him to be an aged and venerable
man; and observing that he was accompanied by T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
and 'Azeez, they said, No doubt this sheykh is the father of these
two young men. The Wezeer then said to them, Who among you is
the Sheykh of the market? They answered, This is he. And the
Wezeer, looking at him and observing him, saw that he was an old
man of grave and respectable aspect, and possessing servants and
young men. The Sheykh of the market greeted them with friendly
compliments, and treated them with great honour, and, having seated
them by his side, said to them, Have ye any business which we may
have the happiness of transacting? The Wezeer answered, Yes: I
am an old man, advanced in age, and I have these two young men:
I have travelled with them through all regions and countries, and
have not entered a town without remaining in it a whole year, that
they might amuse themselves with the sight of it and become
acquainted with its inhabitants; and now I have come to this your
town, and have chosen to make a stay in it: I therefore desire of thee
one of the best shops, that I may seat them in it to traffic, and that
they may amuse themselves with the sight of this city, and acquire
the manners of its people, and obtain an experience in buying and
selling and other commercial transactions.</p>

<p>So the Sheykh of the market replied, There will be no harm in
doing so:&mdash;and, looking at the two young men, he was delighted
with them, and he arose and stood like a servant before them to wait
upon them. And afterwards he went and prepared for them the
shop: it was in the midst of the market, and there was none larger
than it, nor any more handsome there; for it was spacious and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
decorated, and contained shelves of ivory and ebony. He then
delivered the keys to the Wezeer (who was also in the garb of a
merchant), and said, God grant that it may be attended with blessings
to thy two sons!<a href="#VIII54" class="fnanchor">54</a> And when the Wezeer had taken the keys of the
shop, he went to it, together with the servants, who deposited in it
their goods; and they ordered the servants to remove thither all the
merchandise and stuffs and rarities that they had. These things were
worth treasuries of wealth; and they transported the whole of them
to the shop. They then passed the night, and in the morning the
Wezeer conducted the two young men to the bath, where they washed
and enjoyed themselves to the utmost, after which they returned to
their abode to rest from the fatigue of bathing, and ate and drank;
and they passed the next night in their abode in the most perfect joy
and happiness. And on the following morning they rose from their
sleep, and, having performed the ablution, recited the divinely-ordained
prayers, and drank their morning-beverage;<a href="#VIII55" class="fnanchor">55</a> and when
daylight came, and the shops and markets were opened, they went
forth from their abode, and repaired to the market, and opened the
shop. The servants had prepared it for them in the handsomest
manner, and spread it with carpets of silk, and placed in it two
mattresses, each of which was worth a hundred pieces of gold; and
upon each mattress they spread a skin such as Kings sit upon, surrounded
with an edge of gold: so T&aacute;j-el-Mulook seated himself upon
one mattress, and 'Azeez upon the other, and the Wezeer sat in the
midst of the shop, while the servants stood before them. The people
heard of them, and crowded about them, and they sold of their
merchandise; and the fame of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook was spread through the
city, and the report of his handsomeness and comeliness was blazed
throughout it. They continued this life for several days, the people
pressing to them; after which the Wezeer addressed T&aacute;j-el-Mulook,
and enjoined him to conceal his case, and, having charged 'Azeez to
keep watch over him, repaired to the house to plan some mode of
proceeding that might be of advantage to them. Meanwhile, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
and 'Azeez sat conversing together; and the former said,
Perhaps some one may come from the lady Duny&agrave;.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 529px; position: relative;"><a name="f195" id="f195"></a><img src="images/fig195.png" width="529" height="509" alt="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook receiving the Old Woman" title="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook receiving the Old Woman" /></div>

<p>Thus T&aacute;j-el-Mulook passed his time days and nights, and slept
not; desire overpowered him, and he became more and more emaciated
and infirm, renouncing the delight of sleep, and abstaining
from drink and food; but still he was like the full moon: and as he
was sitting one day, lo, an old woman approached and advanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
towards him, followed by two female slaves, and she continued to
draw near until she stopped at his shop. Beholding his graceful
person, and his handsome and lovely aspect, she wondered at his
beauty, and said, Extolled be the perfection of Him who created thee!
Extolled be the perfection of Him who hath made thee a temptation
to all creatures!&mdash;She ceased not to gaze at him, and said, This is not
a mortal: this is no other than a noble angel!<a href="#VIII56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Then drawing
close to him, she saluted him, and he returned her salutation, and
rose to her, standing upon his feet,<a href="#VIII57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and smiled in her face. All this
he did at the hinting of 'Azeez; after which he seated her by his side,
and occupied himself with fanning her until she had rested herself;
when she said to him, O my son! O thou of perfect qualities and
graces! art thou of this country?&mdash;T&aacute;j-el-Mulook answered her,
with an eloquent and sweet and charming voice, By Allah, O my
mistress, in my life I never entered this country until now; and I
have not taken up my abode in it but for the sake of amusement.
And she wished him honour, and welcomed him, and said, What stuffs
hast thou brought with thee? Show me something beautiful; for the
beautiful bringeth not anything but what is beautiful.&mdash;And when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
T&aacute;j-el-Mulook heard her words his heart palpitated; but he understood
not their meaning: so 'Azeez made a sign to him; and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
said to her, I have everything that thou desirest of stuffs
suitable only to Kings and the daughters of Kings. For whom,
then, wouldst thou purchase, that I may display to thee what will
be appropriate?&mdash;He desired by this question to learn the meaning
of her words; and she answered, I want some stuff suitable to the
lady Duny&agrave;, the daughter of King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n. On hearing the
mention of his beloved, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook rejoiced exceedingly, and
said to 'Azeez, Bring me the most magnificent of the goods that
are by thee. And 'Azeez gave him a wrapper, and untied it before
her, and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook said to her, Choose what will suit her; for
this is such as is not found with any but me. So the old woman
chose some stuff that was worth a thousand pieces of gold; and
said, What is the price of this?&mdash;What! said he, shall I bargain
with a person like thee respecting this contemptible thing? Praise
be to God who hath made me acquainted with thee.&mdash;And the old
woman exclaimed, I invoke, for thy comely face, the protection of
the Lord of the Daybreak!<a href="#VIII58" class="fnanchor">58</a> for verily thy face is comely, and so
are thine actions. Joy be to her who possesseth thee, and especially
if she be endowed with beauty like thee!&mdash;Upon this, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
laughed until he fell backwards, and said [within himself], O Accomplisher
of desires by the means of wicked old women!<a href="#VIII59" class="fnanchor">59</a> And she said
to him, O my son, what is thy name? He answered, My name is
T&aacute;j-el-Mulook.&mdash;This, she replied, is one of the names of Kings; but
thou art in the garb of the merchants. So 'Azeez said, From the
affection of his family for him, and the high estimation in which they
held him, they gave him this name. And the old woman replied,
Thou hast spoken truth. May God avert from you the evil of the
envious, though hearts be broken by your charms!</p>

<p>She then took the stuff, and departed, confounded by his handsomeness
and loveliness and elegant form; and she proceeded until
she went in to the lady Duny&agrave;, when she said to her, O my mistress,
I have brought thee some beautiful stuff.&mdash;Shew it me, said the lady.
And she replied, O my mistress, here it is: turn it over, and behold
it. And when the lady Duny&agrave; saw it, she said to her, O my nurse,
verily this is beautiful stuff; I have not seen such in our city!&mdash;O my
mistress, replied the old woman, the seller of it surpasseth it in beauty.
It seemeth as though Ri&#7693;w&aacute;n had opened the gates of Paradise and
neglected them, and so the merchant who selleth this stuff had come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
forth from it. I wish he were with thee; for he is a temptation to
every one who beholdeth him. He hath come to our city with these
stuffs for the sake of amusement.&mdash;At these words of the old woman
the lady Duny&agrave; laughed, and said, Allah afflict thee, thou ill-omened
old woman! Thou hast spoken nonsense, and art become insane.&mdash;She
then added, Give me the stuff that I may examine it closely. So
the old woman handed it to her, and she looked at it again, and saw
that it was but little, and that its price was great; and she wondered
at its beauty; for she had never in her life seen anything like it. The
old woman then said to her, O my mistress, if thou didst behold its
owner, thou wouldst know that he is the handsomest person on the
face of the earth. And the lady Duny&agrave; said to her, Didst thou ask
him if he had any want to be performed, that he might acquaint us
with it, and thou mightest accomplish it for him? The old woman,
shaking her head, replied, Allah preserve thy sagacity! By Allah, he
hath a want. And is any person without one?&mdash;Go to him, then,
said the lady Duny&agrave;, and salute him, and say to him, I have been
honoured by thine arrival in our city, and whatever want thou hast, we
will perform it for thee on the head and the eye.</p>

<p>The old woman, therefore, returned immediately to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook,
and when he saw her, his heart leaped with joy, and he rose to her,
standing upon his feet, and, taking her hand, seated her by his side.
So when she had sat and rested herself, she informed him of that
which the lady Duny&agrave; had said. On hearing this, he was filled with
the utmost joy; his bosom expanded, and he said within himself, I
have accomplished my wish! He then said to the old woman,
Perhaps thou wilt convey to her a letter from me, and bring me back
the answer. She replied, I hear and obey. And when he heard her
reply, he said to 'Azeez, Give me an inkhorn and paper, and a pen of
brass. And 'Azeez having given him these things, he wrote the
following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I write to thee a letter, O object of my petition, expressive of the torment that I suffer from separation;</span>
<span class="i0">And first, I make known to thee the ardour of my heart; and secondly, my desire and eager longing;</span>
<span class="i0">And thirdly, the expiring of my life and patience; and fourthly, that all the violence of my love remaineth;</span>
<span class="i0">And fifthly, I ask, When shall I behold thee? and sixthly, When shall be the day of our union?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then added beneath, This letter is from the captive of desire,
incarcerated in the prison of longing expectation, to whom there can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
be no liberation but by enjoying an interview, even were it with the
phantom of the object of his hope; for he is enduring a painful
torment from the separation of his beloved.&mdash;Then his tears flowed,
and he wrote these two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I write unto thee with my tears flowing, and the drops from my eyes descending incessantly;</span>
<span class="i0">But I am not despairing of the favour of my Lord: perhaps some day our union may take place.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then folded the letter, and sealed it, and gave it to the old woman,
saying, Convey it to the lady Duny&agrave;. She replied, I hear and obey.
And he gave her a thousand pieces of gold, and said, Receive this as
a present from me. So the old woman took it and departed, praying
for him.</p>

<p>She stopped not until she went in to the lady Duny&agrave;, who, when
she beheld her, said to her, O my nurse, what hath he demanded that
we should do for him?&mdash;O my mistress, she answered, he hath sent
with me a letter, and I know not its contents. And she handed the
letter to her. So the lady Duny&agrave; took it and read it, and understood
its meaning, and exclaimed, Whence is he, and to what doth he aspire,
that this merchant openeth a correspondence with me? Then slapping
her face, she said, Were it not for my fear of God (whose name be
exalted!) I would crucify him upon his shop. So the old woman
said to her, What is in this letter, that it hath disturbed thy heart?
Doth it contain a complaint of oppression, or a demand for the price
of the stuff?&mdash;Wo to thee! she answered: it containeth not that, nor
anything but love and affection; and all this is through thee. Or, if
not, how should this devil presume to employ these words?&mdash;O my
mistress, replied the old woman, thou art residing in thy lofty palace,
and no one can obtain access to thee; not even the flying bird. Allah
preserve thee from blame and censure! Thou hast nothing to fear
from the barking of dogs. Be not angry with me for my bringing
thee this letter when I knew not its contents: but it is my opinion
that thou shouldst return him an answer, and threaten him in it with
slaughter, and forbid him from employing these vain words; for he
will abstain, and not do so again.&mdash;The lady Duny&agrave; said, I fear to
write to him, lest he covet me more. But the old woman replied,
When he heareth the threatening, and promise of punishment, he will
desist from his present conduct. So she said, Bring me an inkhorn
and paper, and a pen of brass. And when they had brought them to
her, she wrote these verses:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O pretender to love and affliction and sleeplessness, and feelings of rapturous passion, and anxiety!</span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou seek for a meeting, O deceived, from a moon? Doth any attain from a moon his wish?</span>
<span class="i0">I advise thine abstaining from thy desire: forbear then; for thou art exposed to peril.</span>
<span class="i0">If thou again make use of these words, I will visit thee with a punishment of the utmost severity.</span>
<span class="i0">By Him who created mankind of clotted blood,<a href="#VIII60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and who gave light to the sun and the moon!</span>
<span class="i0">If thou repeat the proposal thou hast made, I will assuredly crucify thee on the trunk of a tree.</span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 523px; position: relative;"><a name="f196" id="f196"></a><img src="images/fig196.png" width="523" height="322" alt="The Lady Duny&agrave; writing" title="The Lady Duny&agrave; writing" /></div>

<p>She then folded up the letter, and gave it to the old woman, saying
to her, Deliver it to him, and say to him, Abstain from these words.
And she replied, I hear and obey.</p>

<p>She took the letter, full of joy,<a href="#VIII61" class="fnanchor">61</a> and went with it to her house,
where she passed the night; and in the morning she repaired to
the shop of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, whom she found expecting her. As soon
as he beheld her, he almost flew with joy, and when she drew near to
him he rose to her, standing upon his feet, and seated her by his side;
and she took forth the letter, and handed it to him, saying, Read its
contents. She then said to him, The lady Duny&agrave;, when she read thy
letter, was enraged; but I coaxed her and jested with her until I made
her laugh, and she was moved with pity for thee, and returned thee
an answer. So T&aacute;j-el-Mulook thanked her for this, and, having
ordered 'Azeez to give her a thousand pieces of gold, read the letter,
and understood it; and he wept violently, so that the heart of the old
woman was moved with compassion for him, and his weeping and
complaining grieved her. She said to him, O my son, and what is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
this paper, that it hath made thee weep? He answered, She
threateneth me with slaughter and crucifixion, and forbiddeth my
writing to her; but if I write not to her, my death will be preferable
to my life; therefore take a reply to her letter, and let her do what
she will.&mdash;By thy youth, replied the old woman, I must risk my life
for thee, and enable thee to attain thy desire, and accomplish for thee
that which is in thy heart. And T&aacute;j-el-Mulook said, Whatsoever
thou dost I will requite thee for it; and it shall be determined by
thee; for thou art experienced in the management of affairs, and
skilled in the modes of intrigue, and everything that is difficult
becometh easy to thee; and God is able to accomplish all things. So
he took a paper, and wrote in it these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She threatened me with slaughter. O my bereavement! Slaughter would be ease to me, and death is decreed.</span>
<span class="i0">Death is better than life prolonged to the love-smitten who is debarred from enjoyment and treated with oppression.</span>
<span class="i0">By Allah, visit a helpless lover; for I am your slave, and the slave is in captivity.</span>
<span class="i0">O my mistress, have mercy on me for my passion; for every one who loveth the virtuous is excusable.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having done this, he sighed heavily, and wept until the old woman
wept with him; after which she took the letter from him, and said
to him, Be happy and cheerful; for I must accomplish for thee
thy wish.</p>

<p>She then arose, and left him as though he were upon the fire,
and repaired to the lady Duny&agrave;, whom she found with a countenance
changed by her anger in consequence of the former epistle of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook;
and she handed her the second letter; whereupon her rage
increased, and she said to the old woman, Did I not tell thee that
he would covet us more?&mdash;And what is this dog, said the old woman,
that he should aspire to thee? The lady Duny&agrave; replied, Go to him,
and say to him, If thou write to her again she will strike off thy head.
But the old woman said, Do thou write this to him in a letter, and I
will take it with me, that his fear may be the greater. So she took
a paper, and wrote in it the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O thou who art heedless of the course of misfortunes, and who canst not accomplish thy desired union!</span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou think, O deceived, to attain to Es-Suh&agrave;,<a href="#VIII62" class="fnanchor">62</a> when thou canst not reach to the shining moon?</span>
<span class="i0">How then dost thou venture to hope for our union, and to hold in thine embrace my javelin-like form?</span>
<span class="i0">Quit, therefore, this project, in fear of my assault on a day of adversity when hair shall become gray,</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
Having folded this letter, she handed it to the old woman, who
took it and repaired with it to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook. At the sight of her
he rose, and said, May God never deprive me of the blessing of thy
coming! And the old woman replied, Receive the answer to thy
letter. So he took the paper and read it, and wept violently, and
said, I desire now some one to kill me; for slaughter would be easier
to me than this my present state of suffering. He then took an
inkhorn and a pen and paper, and wrote a letter expressed in these
two verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O my hope, persist not in abandonment and cruelty; but visit a lover drowned in desire.</span>
<span class="i0">Think not that I can survive this oppression; for my soul departeth at the loss of my beloved.</span>

<p>And he folded the letter, and gave it to the old woman, saying to
her, I have wearied thee to no purpose. And again he ordered
'Azeez to give her a thousand pieces of gold, and said to her, O
my mother, this paper must be followed by complete union or complete
separation.&mdash;O my son, she replied, by Allah, I desire for thee
nothing but good fortune: and I wish she may be with thee; for
thou art the shining moon, and she is the rising sun; and if I do
not bring you together, no profit will remain to me in my life. I
have passed my life in the practice of artifice and deceit, until I have
attained the age of ninety years; and how then should I fail of uniting
two persons in opposition to all law?</p>

<p>Then, having bidden him farewell, and soothed his mind, she
departed, and proceeded without stopping to the lady Duny&agrave;; but
she had hidden the paper in her hair; and when she sat down with
her mistress, she scratched her head, and said, O my mistress, perhaps
thou wilt untwist my hair; for it is a long time since I have entered
the bath. So the lady Duny&agrave; made bare her arms to the elbows, and
untwisted the old woman's hair; whereupon the paper fell from her
head; and the lady Duny&agrave;, seeing it, said, What is this paper? The
old woman answered, It seemeth that, when I was sitting at the shop
of the merchant, this paper caught to me: give it me, therefore, that
I may return it to him. But the lady Duny&agrave; opened it and read it,
and understood its contents, and exclaimed, This is a trick of thine,
and were it not for the fact of thy having reared me, I would lay
violent hands upon thee this moment. God hath afflicted me by this
merchant, and all that I have experienced from him hath been through
thy means. I know not from what country this man hath come. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
one but he could ever use such boldness towards me. I fear that this
affair which hath happened to me may be discovered, and especially
since it relateth to a man who is neither of my family nor of my
equals.&mdash;The old woman then addressed her, and said, No one can
utter a word on this subject, through fear of thy power, and of the
dignity of thy father: and there will be no harm in thy returning him
an answer.&mdash;O my nurse, replied the lady Duny&agrave;, this is a devil.
How hath he dared to use these words, and feared not the power of
the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n? I am perplexed respecting his case; for if I give orders
to kill him, it will not be right: and if I leave him, he will increase
in his boldness.&mdash;Write to him a letter, rejoined the old woman; and
perhaps he will be restrained. She therefore demanded a paper and
an inkhorn and a pen, and wrote to him the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though repeatedly rebuked, still gross ignorance inciteth thee. How oft shall my hand write verses to forbid thee?</span>
<span class="i0">Thou increasest in eagerness after each prohibition; but I will only permit thee to conceal thy secret.</span>
<span class="i0">Conceal then thy love, and never more utter it; for if thou utter it, I will not regard thee.</span>
<span class="i0">If thou repeat what thou hast said, the raven of separation will announce thy fate:</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
<span class="i0">In a little time will death overtake thee, and thy resting-place be beneath the earth:</span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt leave thy family, O deceived, in sorrow, when the swords of love have prevented thine escape.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having then folded the paper, she gave it to the old woman, who
took it, and went with it to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, and gave it to him; and
when he had read it, and was convinced that she was hard-hearted,
and that he could not obtain access to her, he complained of his case
to the Wezeer, and desired his prudent counsel. The Wezeer replied,
Know that there remaineth for thee nothing that can be of avail,
except thy writing to her another letter, and invoking retribution
upon her. So he said, O my brother, O 'Azeez, write in my stead,
according to thy knowledge. And 'Azeez took the paper, and wrote
these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O my Lord, by the Five Elders,<a href="#VIII63" class="fnanchor">63</a> deliver me; and to her who hath afflicted me transfer my anguish!</span>
<span class="i0">For Thou knowest that I am suffering a tormenting flame, and my beloved hath oppressed me, and will not pity me.</span>
<span class="i0">How long shall I feel tenderly to her in my affliction! And how long shall she tyrannize over my weakness!</span>
<span class="i0">I wander in agonies never ending, and find not a person, O my Lord, to assist me.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>'Azeez then folded the letter, and handed it to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook; and
when he had read it, it pleased him, and he gave it to the old woman.</p>

<p>So she took it, and repaired with it to the lady Duny&agrave;, who, as
soon as she had read it, and understood its contents, fell into a violent
rage, and exclaimed, All that hath befallen me hath been through the
means of this ill-omened old woman! And she called out to the
female slaves and eunuchs, and said, Seize this artful old woman, and
beat her with your slippers.&mdash;So they fell to beating her with their
slippers until she fainted; and when she recovered, the lady Duny&agrave;
said to her, O wicked old woman, were it not for my fear of God
(whose name be exalted!) I had killed thee. She then said to her
attendants, Beat her again. And they beat her again until she
fainted; after which she ordered them to throw her outside the door;
and they dragged her along upon her face and threw her down before
the door.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 483px; position: relative;"><a name="f198" id="f198"></a><img src="images/fig198.png" width="483" height="524" alt="The Old Woman beaten by Female Slaves" title="The Old Woman beaten by Female Slaves" /></div>

<p>When she recovered, therefore, she rose, and, walking and resting
now and then, arrived at her abode. She waited until the morning,
and then rose and proceeded to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, whom she acquainted
with all that had befallen her; and it vexed him, and he said to her,
We are grieved, O my mother, for that which hath happened to thee:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
but everything is in accordance with fate and destiny. She replied,
Be happy and cheerful; for I will not cease my endeavours until I
procure thee an interview with her, and obtain for thee access to this
vile woman who hath tortured me with beating. T&aacute;j-el-Mulook then
said to her, Acquaint me with the cause of her hatred of men. She
replied, It is in consequence of her having had a dream.&mdash;And what
was that dream? he asked. She answered, She was sleeping one
night, and saw a fowler who set his snare upon the ground, and
sprinkled around it some wheat, and then seated himself near it; and
there was not a single bird near it but it came to that snare. And she
saw, among the birds, two pigeons, a male and a female; and while
she was looking at the snare, the foot of the male bird became
entangled in it, and he began to struggle; whereupon all the other
birds flew away from him in alarm; but his mate returned to him,
and flew around over him, and then, alighting upon the snare, while
the fowler was inadvertent, began to peck at the mesh in which was
the foot of the male, and pulled it with her beak, until she liberated
his foot; and she flew away with him. Then, after this, the fowler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
came and readjusted the snare, and seated himself at a distance from
it; and but a little while had elapsed when the birds descended, and
the snare caught the female pigeon; upon which all the other birds
flew away in alarm, and among them the male pigeon, who returned
not to his mate: so the fowler came and took the female bird, and
killed her. And the lady Duny&agrave; awoke terrified by her dream, and
said, Every male is like this, destitute of good; and men universally
are devoid of goodness to women.&mdash;And when the old woman had
finished her story to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, he said to her, O my mother, I
wish to obtain one glance at her, though my death be the consequence:
contrive, therefore, some stratagem for me, that I may see
her.&mdash;Know, then, said she, that she hath a garden adjacent to her
palace, for her diversion, and she goeth out into it once in every
month, from the private door, and remaineth in it ten days. The
time of her thus going forth to divert herself hath now arrived, and
when she is about to do so I will come to thee and inform thee, that
thou mayest go thither and meet her; and do thou take care not to
quit the garden: for probably, if she behold thy handsome and comely
aspect, her heart will be captivated by love of thee; since love is the
most powerful means of effecting union.</p>

<p>He replied, I hear and obey:&mdash;and he arose, and quitted the shop
with 'Azeez, and they both, taking with them the old woman, repaired
to their abode, and acquainted her with it; after which, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
said to 'Azeez, O my brother, I have no further want of the shop; for
I have accomplished the purpose for which I took it; and I give it to
thee, with all that it containeth, because thou hast come abroad with
me, and absented thyself from thy country. And 'Azeez accepted his
present, and they sat conversing together; T&aacute;j-el-Mulook asking him
respecting his strange adventures, and 'Azeez relating what had
happened to him. Then, addressing the Wezeer, they acquainted him
with the purpose of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, and asked him, What is to be
done? He answered, Let us go to the garden. So each of them
clad himself in the richest of his apparel, and they went forth, followed
by three memlooks, and repaired to the garden. They beheld it
abounding with trees, and with many rivulets, and saw the superintendent
sitting at the gate. They saluted him, therefore, and he returned
their salutation, and the Wezeer handed to him a hundred pieces of
gold, saying to him, I beg thee to receive this money, and to buy for
us something to eat; for we are strangers, and I have with me these
children whom I wish to divert. So the gardener took the pieces of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
gold, and replied, Enter, and divert yourselves; for the whole of it is
your property: and sit down until I return to you with something for
you to eat. He then went to the market, and the Wezeer and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
and 'Azeez entered the garden after the gardener had departed
to the market; and soon the latter returned, bringing a roasted lamb,
which he placed before them. And they ate, and washed their hands,
and sat conversing together; and the Wezeer said, Inform me
respecting this garden: doth it belong to thee, or dost thou rent it?
The sheykh replied, It is not mine, but belongeth to the King's
daughter, the lady Duny&agrave;.&mdash;And what, said the Wezeer, is thy
monthly salary? He answered, One piece of gold, and no more.
And the Wezeer, taking a view of the garden, beheld there a lofty
but old pavilion; and he said, O sheykh, I desire to perform here a
good work by which thou wilt be reminded of me.&mdash;And what good
thing dost thou desire to do? asked the sheykh. The Wezeer said,
Take these three hundred pieces of gold. And when the superintendent
heard the mention of the gold, he replied, O my master, do
whatsoever thou wilt. So he took the pieces of gold; and the Wezeer
said to him, If it be the will of God (whose name be exalted!), we will
execute in this place a good work.</p>

<p>They then went forth from him, and returned to their abode, and
passed the next night; and on the morrow, the Wezeer caused a
whitewasher to be brought, and a painter, and an excellent goldsmith;
and, having provided them with all the implements that they required,
introduced them into the garden, and ordered them to whitewash that
pavilion and to decorate it with various kinds of paintings. After
which he gave orders to bring the gold, and the ultramarine pigment,
and said to the painter, Delineate, at the upper end of this saloon, the
figure of a fowler, as though he had set his snare, and a female pigeon
had fallen into it, and had become entangled in it by her bill. And
when the painter had finished his picture on one portion, the Wezeer
said to him, Now paint, on this other portion, as before, and represent
the female pigeon in the snare, and shew that the fowler hath taken
her, and put the knife to her neck; and on the other side paint the
figure of a great bird of prey, that hath captured the male pigeon, and
fixed his talons into him. So he did this; and when he had finished
these designs which the Wezeer had described to him, they took leave
of the gardener, and returned to their abode.</p>

<p>There they sat conversing together; and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook said to
'Azeez, O my brother, recite to me some verses: perhaps my heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
may thereby be dilated, and these troubling reflections may be dispelled,
and the flame that is in my heart be quenched. And upon
this, 'Azeez, with charming modulations, chanted these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ibn-Seen&agrave;<a href="#VIII64" class="fnanchor">64</a> hath asserted that the lover's remedy consisteth in melodious sounds,</span>
<span class="i0">And the company of one like his beloved, and the pleasures of a dessert and wine and a garden:</span>
<span class="i0">But I have taken another in thy stead to cure myself, and fate and contingency aided me:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet I found that love was a mortal disease, for which Ibn-Seen&agrave;'s medicine was vain.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the old woman remained alone in her house; and the
lady Duny&agrave; longed to divert herself in the garden; but she used not
to go forth save with the old woman: so she sent to her, and conciliated
her, and soothed her mind, and said to her, I desire to go out into the
garden, to amuse myself with the sight of its trees and fruits, and that
my heart may be dilated by its flowers. The old woman replied, I
hear and obey; but I would first go to my house and dress myself,
and I will be with thee again.&mdash;Go, then, to thy house, rejoined the
lady Duny&agrave;; but be not long absent from me. The old woman,
therefore, went forth from her, and repaired to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, and
said to him, Make ready, and clothe thyself in the richest of thine
apparel, and betake thyself to the garden, and go in to the gardener
and salute him, and then conceal thyself in the garden. He replied,
I hear and obey. And she agreed with him respecting a sign to be
made; after which she returned to the lady Duny&agrave;. And when she
had gone, the Wezeer arose, and clad T&aacute;j-el-Mulook in a suit of the
most magnificent of the apparel of Kings, worth five thousand pieces
of gold, and girded him with a girdle of gold set with jewels, and
repaired to the garden. On arriving at its gate, they found the
superintendent sitting there; and when he saw T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, he
rose to him, standing upon his feet, and, receiving him with reverence
and honour, opened to him the gate, and said to him, Enter, and
divert thyself in the garden. But the gardener knew not that the
King's daughter would enter the garden that day. And when T&aacute;j-el-Mulook
had gone in, he waited but a short time, and heard a noise;
and before he knew the cause, the eunuchs and female slaves came
forth from the private door; and as soon as the superintendent beheld
them, he went and acquainted T&aacute;j-el-Mulook with their coming,
saying to him, O my lord, what is to be done, now that the King's
daughter, the lady Duny&agrave;, hath come? He answered, No harm will
befall thee; for I will conceal myself in some place in the garden. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>

<span class="figright3" style="width: 204px; position: relative;"><a name="f200" id="f200"></a><img src="images/fig200.png" width="204" height="920" alt="Illustrations of the Stratagem in the Lady Duny&aacute;'s Garden" title="Illustrations of the Stratagem in the Lady Duny&aacute;'s Garden" /></span>

the gardener charged him to use the utmost
caution in concealing himself, and left him,
and departed.</p>

<p>And when the King's daughter, with her
female slaves and the old woman, entered the
garden, the old woman said within herself, If
the eunuchs be with us, we shall not attain
our wish. So she said to the King's daughter,
O my mistress, I would propose to thee a
thing productive of ease to thy heart. And
the lady Duny&agrave; replied, Propose what thou
wilt. The old woman therefore said, O my
mistress, thou hast no need of these eunuchs
at the present time; nor will thy heart be
dilated as long as they are with us: so dismiss
them from us.&mdash;Thou hast spoken truly,
replied the lady Duny&agrave;:&mdash;and she dismissed
them; and a little while after, as she was
walking, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook beheld her, and gazed
at her beauty and loveliness, while she knew
it not; and every time that he looked at her he
fainted, by reason of her surpassing beauty.
The old woman in the meantime led her on
by conversation to the pavilion which the
Wezeer had ordered to be painted; and,
entering this pavilion, the lady Duny&agrave; took a
view of its paintings, and saw the birds and
the fowler and the pigeons; whereupon she
exclaimed, Extolled be the perfection of God!
Verily this is the representation of what I
beheld in my dream!&mdash;And

<span class="figleft3" style="width: 180px; position: relative;"><a name="f199" id="f199"></a><img src="images/fig199.png" width="180" height="228" alt="Illustrations of the Stratagem in the Lady Duny&aacute;'s Garden" title="Illustrations of the Stratagem in the Lady Duny&aacute;'s Garden" /></span>

she continued
gazing at the
figures of the birds
and the fowler and
the snare, full of
wonder; and said,
O my nurse, I used
to censure men, and
hate them; but see
the fowler, how he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
hath killed the female bird, and the male hath escaped, and desired to
return to the female to liberate her, but the bird of prey hath met him
and captured him. The old woman, however, affected ignorance to
her, and proceeded to divert her with talk until they both approached
the place where T&aacute;j-el-Mulook was concealed; upon which she made
a sign to him that he should walk beneath the windows of the pavilion;
and while the lady Duny&agrave; stood there, she looked aside, and saw him,
and, observing the beauty of his face, and his elegant form, she said, O
my nurse, whence is this handsome youth? The old woman answered,
I know him not; but I imagine that he is the son of a great King;
for he is of the utmost beauty and loveliness. And the lady Duny&agrave;
was enraptured with him. The spells that bound her were dissolved,
her reason was overcome by his beauty and loveliness and his elegant
person, and she was affected by violent love: so she said to the old
woman, O my nurse, verily this young man is handsome. The old
woman replied, Thou hast spoken truth, O my mistress. And she
made a sign to the King's son to return to his house. The fire of
desire flamed within him, and his rapture and distraction became
excessive; but he went, and bade farewell to the superintendent, and
departed to his abode, that he might not disobey the old woman, and
acquainted the Wezeer and 'Azeez that she had made a sign to him to
depart. And they both exhorted him to be patient, saying to him, If
the old woman did not know that there was an object to be attained
by thy return, she had not made a sign to thee to do so.</p>

<p>Now to return to the lady Duny&agrave;.&mdash;Desire overcame her, and her
rapture and distraction increased; so she said to the old woman, I
know not how to obtain an interview with this young man but through
thy means. The old woman exclaimed, I seek refuge with Allah from
Satan the accursed! Thou hast no desire for men; and how, then,
have fears affected thee in consequence of the love of him? But, by
Allah, none other than he is suited to thy youth.&mdash;O my nurse,
rejoined the lady Duny&agrave;, assist me to obtain an interview with him,
and thou shalt receive from me a thousand pieces of gold, and a dress
of the same value: if thou assist me not to gain him, I shall die
inevitably. So the old woman replied, Go thou to thy palace, and I
will devise means to bring you together, and give my life to satisfy
you both. The lady Duny&agrave; then returned to her palace, while the old
woman repaired to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook; and when he saw her, he rose to
her, and stood, and received her with respect and honour, seating her
by his side; and she said to him, The stratagem hath succeeded. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
then related to him what had occurred between her and the lady
Duny&agrave;; and he said to her, When shall be the interview? She
answered, To-morrow. And he gave her a thousand pieces of gold,
and a garment of the same value: and she took them, and departed,
and stopped not until she went in to the lady Duny&agrave;, who said to her,
O my nurse, what news hast thou brought from the beloved?&mdash;I have
discovered his abode, she answered; and to-morrow I will bring him
to thee. And at this the lady Duny&agrave; rejoiced, and gave her a thousand
pieces of gold, and a garment of the same value; and she took them,
and returned to her house.</p>

<p>She passed the next night, and in the morning she went forth and
repaired to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, and, having clad him in women's apparel,
said to him, Walk behind me, and incline thy body from side to side
as thou steppest,<a href="#VIII65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and proceed not with a hasty pace, nor take notice
of any one who may speak to thee. And after she had thus charged
him, she went forth, and he behind her in his female attire; and she
proceeded to instruct him, on the way, how to act, that he might not
fear. She continued on her way, he following her, until they arrived
at the entrance of the palace, when she entered, and he also after her,
and she passed through successive doors and antechambers until she
had conducted him through seven doors. And when she arrived at
the seventh door, she said to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, Fortify thy heart, and if
I call out to thee, and say to thee, O slave-girl, advance!&mdash;be not
tardy in thy pace, but hasten on, and when thou hast entered the
antechamber beyond, look to thy left: thou wilt see a saloon with
seven doors; and do thou count five doors, and enter the sixth; for
within it is the object of thy desire.&mdash;And whither goest <i>thou</i>? said
T&aacute;j-el-Mulook. She answered, I have no place to go to; but perhaps
I may wait after thee and speak with the chief eunuch. She then
proceeded, and he followed her, until they arrived at the door where
was the chief eunuch; and he saw with her T&aacute;j-el-Mulook in the
attire of a female slave, and said to her, What is the business of this
slave-girl who is with thee? She answered him, The lady Duny&agrave;
hath heard that this girl is skilled in different kinds of work, and she
desireth to purchase her. But the eunuch replied, I know neither
slave-girl nor any other person; and no one shall enter without being
searched by me, as the King hath commanded me. Upon this, the
old woman, manifesting anger, said to him, I knew that thou wast a
man of sense and of good manners; and if thou art changed I will
acquaint her with this, and inform her that thou hast offered opposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
to her female slave. She then called out to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, and said
to him, Advance, O slave-girl! And immediately he entered the antechamber,
as she had commanded him, and the eunuch was silent, and
said no more. So T&aacute;j-el-Mulook counted five doors, and entered the
sixth, and found the lady Duny&agrave; standing expecting him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px; position: relative;"><a name="f201" id="f201"></a><img src="images/fig201.png" width="469" height="501" alt="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and the Lady Duny&agrave;" title="T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and the Lady Duny&agrave;" /></div>

<p>As soon as she beheld him, she knew him, and pressed him to her
bosom, and he embraced her in like manner; and the old woman,
coming in to them, contrived a pretext to dismiss the female slaves;
after which the lady Duny&agrave; said to her, Be thou keeper of the door.
She then remained alone with T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, and they passed the
whole night in innocent dalliance.<a href="#VIII66" class="fnanchor">66</a> And on the following morning
she closed the door upon him and the old woman, and entering
another apartment, sat there according to her custom; and her
female slaves came to her, and she transacted their affairs and conversed
with them, and then said to them, Go forth from me now; for
I desire to amuse myself in solitude. So they left her, and she
returned to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and the old woman, taking with her some
food for them; and thus they ceased not to do for a whole month.</p>

<p>As to the Wezeer, however, and 'Azeez, when T&aacute;j-el-Mulook had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
gone to the palace of the King's daughter and remained all this time,
they concluded that he would never return from it, and that he was
inevitably lost; and 'Azeez said to the Wezeer, O my father, what wilt
thou do? The Wezeer answered, O my son, this affair is one of
difficulty, and if we return not to his father to acquaint him, he will
blame us for our negligence. So they prepared themselves immediately,
and journeyed towards El-Ar&#7693; el-Kha&#7693;r&agrave; and El-'Amoodeyn<a href="#VIII67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and the
royal residence of the King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, and traversed the valleys
night and day until they went in and presented themselves before the
King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h; and they informed him of that which had
happened to his son, and that they had learnt no news of him since
he had entered the palace of the King's daughter. On hearing this,
he was as though the day of resurrection had surprised him: his
sorrow was intense, and he gave orders to make a proclamation of war
throughout his dominions. He then sent forth his troops outside the
city, and caused the tents to be pitched for them, and remained in his
pavilion until the forces had assembled from all the quarters of his
kingdom. His subjects loved him for his great justice and beneficence,
and he departed with an army that covered the earth as far as the
eye could reach, for the purpose of demanding his son T&aacute;j-el-Mulook.</p>

<p>In the meantime, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and the lady Duny&agrave; continued
together for half a year, every day increasing in mutual love; and the
love and distraction and rapture of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook so augmented that
he opened to her his mind, and said to her, Know, O beloved of my
heart, that the longer I remain with thee, the more do my distraction
and ecstasy and desire increase; for I have not altogether attained my
wish. So she said, What dost thou wish, O light of my eye, and
delight of my heart? He answered, I desire to acquaint thee with
my true history: know, then, that I am not a merchant, but a King,
son of a King, and the name of my father is the Supreme King
Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, who sent the Wezeer as ambassador to thy father to
demand thee for me in marriage; and when the news came to thee
thou refusedst to consent.&mdash;He then related to her his story from first
to last; and added, I desire now to repair to my father, that he may
send an ambassador again to thy father, to demand thee in marriage
from him, and so we shall remain at ease.&mdash;And when she heard this,
she rejoiced exceedingly: for it coincided with her wish; and they
passed the next night determined upon this proceeding.</p>

<p>But it happened, in accordance with destiny, that sleep overcame
them unusually that night, and they remained until the sun had risen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
The King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n was then upon his royal seat, with the emeers
of his empire before him, and the chief of the goldsmiths presented
himself, having in his hand a large round casket: and he advanced,
and, opening it before the King, took forth from it an elegant box
worth a hundred thousand pieces of gold for the jewels it contained,
and rubies and emeralds, such as no King of the earth could procure.
And when the King saw it, he wondered at its beauty; and he looked
towards the chief eunuch, to whom the affair with the old woman had
happened (as above described), and said to him, O K&aacute;foor,<a href="#VIII68" class="fnanchor">68</a> take this
box, and go with it to the lady Duny&agrave;. So the eunuch took it, and
proceeded until he arrived at the chamber of the King's daughter,
when he found its door closed, and the old woman sleeping at its
threshold, and he exclaimed, Until this hour are ye sleeping? And
when the old woman heard what he said, she awoke from her sleep,
and, in her fear of him, said, Wait until I bring the key. She then went
forth and fled. The eunuch, therefore, knew that she was alarmed,
and he displaced the door,<a href="#VIII69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and, entering the chamber, found the lady
Duny&agrave; asleep with T&aacute;j-el-Mulook. At the sight of this, he was perplexed
at his case, and was meditating to return to the King, when
the lady Duny&agrave; awoke, and found him by her; and she was troubled,
and her countenance became pale, and she said, O K&aacute;foor, veil what
God hath veiled. But he replied, I cannot conceal anything from the
King. And he closed the door upon them, and returned to the King.
So the King said to him, Hast thou given the box to thy mistress?
The eunuch answered, Take the box: here it is. I cannot conceal
from thee anything. Know that I beheld, with the lady Duny&agrave;, a
handsome young man, sleeping in the same chamber.  The King
therefore ordered that they should be both brought before him; and
when they had come into his presence, he said to them, What are
these deeds? And he was violently enraged, and, seizing a dagger,<a href="#VIII70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
was about to strike with it T&aacute;j-el-Mulook; but the lady Duny&agrave; threw
her head upon him, and said to her father, Slay me before him. The
King, however, chid her, and ordered them to convey her back to her
chamber. Then looking towards T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, he said to him, Wo
to thee! Whence art thou, and who is thy father, and what hath
emboldened thee to act thus towards my daughter?&mdash;Know, O King,
answered T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, that, if thou put me to death, thou wilt
perish, and thou and all in thy dominions will repent.&mdash;And why so?
said the King. He answered, Know that I am the son of the King
Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, and thou wilt not be aware of the consequence when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
he will approach thee with his horsemen and his infantry. And when
King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n heard this, he desired to defer putting him to
death; and to imprison him until he should see whether his assertion
were true; but his Wezeer said to him, O King of the age, it is my
advice that thou hasten the execution of this young wretch, since he
hath been guilty of presumption towards the daughters of Kings. So
he said to the executioner, Strike off his head; for he is a traitor.
And the executioner took him, and, having bound him firmly, raised
his hand, and made a sign of consultation to the emeers a first and a
second time, desiring by this that some delay might take place; but
the King called out to him, How long wilt thou consult? If thou do
so again I will strike off thy head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px; position: relative;"><a name="f202" id="f202"></a><img src="images/fig202.png" width="492" height="518" alt="Scene on the Arrival of the Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h" title="Scene on the Arrival of the Troops of Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h" /></div>

<p>The executioner, therefore, raised his hand until his arm-pit
appeared, and was about to strike off his head, when loud cries were
heard, and, the people closed their shops. So the King said to the
executioner, Hasten not. And he sent a person to learn the news for
him; and the messenger went, and, soon returning, said to the King,
I beheld an army like the roaring sea agitated with waves; their
horses are prancing, and the earth trembleth beneath them, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
know not wherefore they are come. And the King was amazed, and
feared lest he should be deposed from his throne. He then said to his
Wezeer, Have none of our troops gone forth to meet this army? But
his words were not finished when his chamberlains came in to him
accompanied by the messengers of the approaching King, and among
them was the Wezeer who had been with T&aacute;j-el-Mulook. He commenced
by salutation; and the King rose to him, and, calling them
near to him, asked them respecting the cause of their coming:
whereupon the Wezeer advanced from among them, and approached
the King, and said to him, Know that he who hath alighted in thy
territories is a King not like the Kings who have preceded him, nor
like the Sul&#7789;&aacute;ns of former times.&mdash;And who is he? said the King.
The Wezeer answered, He is the lord of justice and security, the fame
of whose magnanimity the caravans have spread abroad, the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n
Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, the lord of El-Ar&#7693; el-Kha&#7693;r&agrave; and El-'Amoodeyn and
the mountains of I&#7779;pah&aacute;n, who loveth justice and equity, and hateth
tyranny and oppression; and he saith to thee, that his son is in thy
dominions and in thy city, and he is the vital spirit of his heart, and
its delight; and if he find him in safety, it is what he desireth, and
thou wilt be thanked and praised; but if he be not found in thy
country, or if any evil hath befallen him, receive tidings of destruction
and of the ruin of thy territories; for thy country shall become a
desert in which the raven shall croak. Thus I have delivered to thee
the message; and peace be on thee.&mdash;When the King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n
heard these words of the envoy, his heart was troubled, and he feared
for his kingdom, and called out to the lords of his empire, and his
wezeers and chamberlains and lieutenants; and when they had come
before him he said to them, Wo unto you! Go down and search
for this young man.&mdash;But he was under the hand of the executioner,
and his appearance was changed through the fear that he suffered.
The Wezeer then, looking aside, found the King's son upon the skin
of blood,<a href="#VIII71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and he recognised him, and arose, and threw himself upon
him. So also did the other messengers: they then unbound him,
and kissed his hands and his feet; whereupon T&aacute;j-el-Mulook opened his
eyes, and, recognising the Wezeer and his companion 'Azeez, fell down
in a swoon through the excess of his joy at their presence.</p>

<p>The King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n was perplexed at his situation, and in great
fear, on discovering that the coming of the army was on account of
this young man; and he arose and walked forward to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook,
and kissed his head, and, with weeping eyes, said to him, O my son,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
be not angry with me: be not angry with the evil-doer for his deed;
but have compassion on my gray hairs, and lay not waste my
dominions. And T&aacute;j-el-Mulook approached him, and kissed his
hand, saying to him, No harm shall befall thee; for thou art in my
estimation as my father; but beware that no evil befall my beloved,
the lady Duny&agrave;.&mdash;O my lord, rejoined the King, fear not for her; for
nought but happiness awaiteth her. And he proceeded to excuse
himself to him, and to soothe the mind of the Wezeer of the King
Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, promising him a large sum of money that he might
conceal from the King what he had seen; after which he ordered the
grandees of his empire to take T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and to conduct him to
the bath, to clothe him in a suit of the best of royal apparel, and bring
him back quickly. So they did this: they conducted him into the bath,
and, having clad him in the suit which the King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n had
allotted him, brought him back to the hall of audience; and when he
came in, the King rose to him, he and all the lords of his empire, and
they all stood to wait upon him. Then T&aacute;j-el-Mulook sat and conversed
with his father's Wezeer and with 'Azeez respecting the events
which had happened to him; and they replied, During that period we
went to thy father, and informed him that thou hadst entered the
palace of the King's daughter, and not come forth from it, and that
thy case appeared doubtful to us; and when he heard this, he made
ready the troops, and we came to this country, and on our arrival have
experienced joy and happiness. So he said to them, Good fortune
hath attended your actions, first and last.</p>

<p>The King, in the meantime, had gone into his daughter, the lady
Duny&agrave;, and found her weeping for T&aacute;j-el-Mulook. She had taken a
sword, and put its hilt to the floor, and its point to the middle of her
bosom, and was leaning over it, saying, I must kill myself, and not
live after my beloved. When her father, therefore, went in to her,
and beheld her in this state, he called out to her, and said, O mistress
of the daughters of Kings, do it not; but have mercy upon thy father
and the people of thy country! Then advancing to her, he said to
her, I conjure thee to abstain, lest evil befall thy father on thy account.
And he acquainted her with the case, telling her that her beloved, the
son of the King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, desired to celebrate his marriage
with her, and adding, The affair of the betrothal and marriage is
committed to thy judgment. And she smiled, and said to him, Did
I not tell thee that he was the son of a Sul&#7789;&aacute;n? I will make him
crucify thee upon a piece of wood worth a couple of pieces of silver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>I
conjure thee by Allah, he exclaimed, that thou have mercy upon thy
father!&mdash;Go to him, she rejoined, and bring him to me. He replied,
On the head and the eye. And he returned from her quickly, and,
going in to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, rejoiced him by what he said. He then
arose with him, and went to her again; and when she beheld T&aacute;j-el-Mulook,
she embraced him in the presence of her father, and clung to
him, and said to him, Thou hast made me desolate by thine absence.
Then looking at her father, she said, Can any one act injuriously
towards such a person as this handsome youth, and he a King, a son
of a King? And upon this the King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n went forth, and
closed the door upon them, and, repairing to the Wezeer and the other
messengers of the father of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, ordered them to inform the
Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h that his son was in prosperity and health, and
enjoying a life of the utmost delight. He gave orders also to carry
forth provisions and pay to the troops of the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h;
and after they had conveyed all that he commanded them to take
forth, he brought out a hundred coursers, and a hundred dromedaries,
and a hundred memlooks, and a hundred concubine slaves, and a
hundred male black slaves, and a hundred female slaves, and sent
them all to him as a present.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 581px; position: relative;"><a name="f203" id="f203"></a><img src="images/fig203.png" width="581" height="270" alt="The Horses sent to Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h" title="The Horses sent to Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h" /></div>

<p>He then repaired to him, with the lords of his empire, and his
chief attendants, and they proceeded until they arrived outside the
city; and when the Sul&#7789;&aacute;n Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h became acquainted with
this he advanced some paces to meet him. The Wezeer and 'Azeez
had informed him of the news, and he rejoiced, and exclaimed, Praise
be to God who hath granted my son the accomplishment of his wish!
And he embraced the King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n, and seated him by his side
upon the couch, and they conversed together; after which the attendants
placed before; them the food, and when they had eaten to satisfaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
they brought them the sweetmeats. Soon after, T&aacute;j-el-Mulook came,
approaching in his rich and ornamented dress; and when his father
beheld him, he rose to him and kissed him, and all who were present
rose to him; and after he had sat with them a while conversing, the
King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h said, I desire to perform my son's contract of
marriage to thy daughter in the presence of witnesses. And King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n
replied, I hear and obey. So he summoned the &#7730;&aacute;&#7693;ee and witnesses,
and they came, and wrote the marriage-contract; and the troops
rejoiced at this. And King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n began to fit out his daughter.</p>

<p>Then T&aacute;j-el-Mulook said to his father, Verily, 'Azeez is a generous
person; he hath performed for me a great service, and wearied himself,
and journeyed with me, and enabled me to attain the object of my
search, ceasing not to exhort me to patience until I accomplished my
wish, and he hath been with us two years separated from his country:
it is my desire, therefore, that we should prepare for him merchandise;
for his country is near. His father replied, Thy opinion is excellent.
So they prepared for him a hundred loads of the most costly stuffs;
and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook bade him farewell, saying to him, O my brother,
accept this as a present. And he accepted it, and kissed the ground
before him and before his father. T&aacute;j-el-Mulook then mounted his
horse, and proceeded with 'Azeez for the space of three miles; after
which, 'Azeez conjured him to return, and said, Were it not for my
mother, I could not endure thy separation; and by Allah, I entreat
thee not to cease acquainting me with thy state. Having thus said,
he bade him farewell, and repaired to his city. He found that his
mother had built for him a tomb in the midst of the house, and she
frequently visited it; and when he entered the house, he found that
she had dishevelled her hair and spread it upon the tomb, and, with
streaming eyes, was reciting these verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Allah, O tomb, have his charms perished; and hath that brilliant countenance changed?</span>
<span class="i0">O tomb, thou art neither a garden nor a firmament: how then can the full moon and flowers be united in thee?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>She then groaned, and recited some other verses; but before she had
finished, 'Azeez went in to her: and when she beheld him, she rose to
him and embraced him, and asked him respecting his long absence:
so he acquainted her with all the events that had happened to him
from first to last, and told her that T&aacute;j-el-Mulook had given him, of
wealth and stuffs, a hundred loads; and she rejoiced at this.&mdash;Such
was the history of 'Azeez.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span></p>

<p>Now as to T&aacute;j-el-Mulook, he returned to his beloved, the lady
Duny&agrave;, and King Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n fitted her out for the journey with her
husband and her father-in-law: he sent to them provisions and presents
and rarities, and they loaded their beasts and departed; and King
Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n accompanied them three days' journey to bid them farewell.
The King Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h then conjured him to return: so he
returned; and T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and his father and his wife continued
their journey night and day until they came in sight of their country.
The city was decorated for them, and they entered it; and the King
Suleym&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h sat upon his throne with his son T&aacute;j-el-Mulook by
his side; and he gave presents, and liberated the persons confined in
the prisons; after which he celebrated for his son a second wedding-festivity:
the songs and instrumental music were continued for a
whole month, and the tire-women crowded around the lady Duny&agrave;,
and she was not tired with the display, nor were they with gazing at
her. T&aacute;j-el-Mulook then took up his abode with her, after an interview
with his father and mother together; and they passed a life of
the utmost delight and enjoyment.</p>

<h5>NOTES TO CHAPTER EIGHTH.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII1" id="VIII1">1.</a></span> The next story to that of Gh&aacute;nim, in my original, is one of very great
length, comprising the greater part of the forty-fourth night and extending to the end
of the hundred and forty-fifth; but interrupted by the contents of my eighth chapter,
which consists of two stories of a very different kind, that appear to have been introduced
to relieve its tediousness. With these, it occupies nearly 162 pages, or not
much less than an eighth part of the whole work. It is the story of the King 'Omar
En-No&#7841;m&aacute;n, and his two sons Sharr-k&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> and &#7692;&oacute;-el-Mek&aacute;n,<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> and his daughter
Nuzhet-ez-Zem&aacute;n,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> &amp;c. It is entirely a fiction, professedly relating to the first century
of the Mohammadan era, "before the reign of the Khaleefeh 'Abd-El-Melik the son of
Marw&aacute;n;" and its main subject is a war with two Greek Kings. Taken altogether,
I deem it unworthy of a place in the present series of tales; and so much of it depends
upon incidents of a most objectionable nature, that I cannot attempt to abridge it; but
a pleasant tale might be composed from it by considerable <i>alterations</i>.</p>

<p>One of the two stories which I have extracted from it, that of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook and
the Lady Duny&agrave;, bears apparent indications of a Persian origin; but in their present
state, the manners and customs &amp;c. which both exhibit are Arab. The scenes of the
events narrated in the story of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook are in Persia and, probably, in India; but
imaginary names appear to be given to the several kingdoms mentioned in it: the
kingdom of El-Ar&#7693; el-Kha&#7693;r&agrave; ("the Green Country") and El-'Amoodeyn (which signifies
"the Two Columns") is said to include the mountains of I&#7779;pah&aacute;n, and its locality is
thereby sufficiently indicated: that of El-Ar&#7693; el-Bey&#7693;&agrave; ("the White Country") I suppose
to be in Persia or India: and as to the Islands of Camphor, I fancy we must be content
to consider them vaguely as appertaining to India: the country in which 'Azeez and
'Azeezeh resided is said to have been near to the Islands of Camphor; but their story is
perfectly Arab.&mdash;The Island of Camphor is also mentioned in the Story of &#7716;asan of
El-Ba&#7779;rah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII2" id="VIII2">2.</a></span> "El-Medeeneh el-Kha&#7693;r&agrave;" signifies "the Green City." See the above
note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII3" id="VIII3">3.</a></span> "The Compassionate" is an epithet here applied to God.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII4" id="VIII4">4.</a></span> See the first note in this series.&mdash;"Zahr," in Arabic, signifies "a
Flower."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII5" id="VIII5">5.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Coats of Mail, and other Armour worn by the Arabs.</i> The Prophet
David is said to have been the first person who manufactured coats of mail; and the
cause of his applying himself to the art was this.&mdash;"He used to go forth in disguise;
and when he found any people who knew him not, he approached them and asked them
respecting the conduct of D&aacute;ood (or David), and they praised him and prayed for
him; but one day as he was asking questions respecting himself as usual, God sent to
him an angel in the form of a human being, who said, 'An excellent man were D&aacute;ood
if he did not take from the public treasury:'&mdash;whereupon the heart of D&aacute;ood was
contracted, and he begged of God to render him independent: so He made iron soft to
him, and it became in his hands as thread; and he used to sell a coat of mail for four
thousand [pieces of money&mdash;whether gold or silver is not said], and with part of this he
obtained food for himself, and part he gave in alms, and with part he fed his family."<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a>&mdash;Hence
an excellent coat of mail is often called by the Arabs "D&aacute;oodee," <i>i. e.</i>
"Davidean." This kind of armour is worn by some Arabs of the Desert in the present
day; but the best specimens, I believe, are mostly found in India. Burckhardt
mentions one tribe of Arabs who have about twenty-five; another, two hundred; and
two others, between thirty and forty. "The dora [properly dir&#7841;] is," he remarks,
"of two sorts, one covering the whole body like a long gown from the elbow, over the
shoulders, down to the knees: this is the sirgh: the other, called kemb&aacute;z, covers the
body only to the waist; the arms from the elbows downwards being covered with two
pieces of steel, fitting into each other, with iron fingers. Thus clad, the Arab completes
his armour by putting on his head an iron cap (t&aacute;s), which is but rarely adorned with
feathers. The price of a coat of mail fluctuates from two hundred to fifteen hundred
piastres.... Those of the best quality are capable of resisting a ball."<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> The coat of
mail is sometimes worn within the ordinary outer tunic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII6" id="VIII6">6.</a></span> This implies that his parents were dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII7" id="VIII7">7.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Public Royal Feasts.</i> On certain periodical festivals, and on other
occasions (as those of the kind here described), it has long been, and still is, a custom
of Muslim princes to give public feasts to all classes of their subjects, in the palace.
El-Ma&#7731;reezee quotes a curious account of the feasts which were given on the festival
following Rama&#7693;&aacute;n to the inhabitants of Cairo, by the F&aacute;&#7789;imee Khaleefehs.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> At the
upper end of a large saloon was placed the sereer (or couch) of the monarch, upon
which he sat with the Wezeer on his right. Upon this seat was placed a round silver
table, with various delicacies, of which they alone ate. Before it, and extending
nearly from the seat to the other extremity of the saloon, was set up a kind of table or
platform (sim&aacute;&#7789;) of painted wood, resembling a number of benches placed together, ten
cubits (or about eighteen or nineteen feet) in width. Along the middle of this were
arranged twenty-one enormous dishes, each containing twenty-one baked sheep, three
years old, and fat; together with fowls, chickens, and young pigeons, in number three
hundred and fifty of each kind; all of which were piled together in an oblong form, to
the height of the stature of a man, and enclosed with dry sweetmeat. The spaces between
these dishes were occupied by nearly five hundred other dishes of earthenware; each of
which contained seven fowls, and was filled up with sweetmeats of various kinds. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>table was strewn with flowers; and cakes of bread made of the finest flower were arranged
along each side. There were also two great edifices of sweetmeats, each weighing
seventeen hundred-weights, which were carried thither by porters with shoulder-poles;
and one of these was placed at the commencement, and the other at the close, of this
sumptuous banquet. When the Khaleefeh and Wezeer had taken their seats upon the
couch, the officers of state who were distinguished by neck-rings or collars,<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> and the
inferior members of the court, seated themselves in the order of their respective ranks;
and when they had eaten, they gave place to others. Two such feasts, given on the
festival after Rama&#7693;&aacute;n and on the "great festival," cost four thousand deen&aacute;rs, or
about two thousand pounds sterling.&mdash;Two military officers, named Ibn-F&aacute;&iuml;z and
Ed-Deylemee, distinguished themselves at these feasts in a very remarkable manner.
Each of them used to eat a baked sheep, and ten fowls dressed with sweetmeats, and
ten pounds of sweetmeats besides, and was presented with a quantity of food carried
away from the feast to his house, together with a large sum of money. One of them
had been a prisoner at 'As&#7731;al&aacute;n; and after he had remained there some time, the
person into whose power he had fallen jestingly told him that if he would eat a calf
belonging to him, the flesh of which weighed several hundred-weights, he would emancipate
him. This feat he accomplished, and thus he obtained his liberation.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p>Several cases of a similar kind to those just mentioned are instanced in a late
work. One of a man who, as related by Vopiscus, was brought before the Emperor
Maximilian [<i>sic</i>], and who devoured a whole calf, and was proceeding to eat up a sheep,
but was prevented. Another, of a man who commenced his repast (in the presence of
Dr. Boehmen, of Wittenberg,) by eating a raw sheep and a sucking pig, and, by
way of dessert, swallowed sixty pounds of prunes, stones and all. A third, of an
attendant of the menagerie of the Botanical Garden in Paris, who used to devour all
the offals of the Theatre of Comparative Anatomy, and ate a dead lion in one day.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII8" id="VIII8">8.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Litters for Travelling.</i> The kind of litter borne by mules is generally
one resembling the p&aacute;lkee (or palanquin): it is borne by four of these animals, two
before and two behind, or by two only, or more commonly by two camels, and sometimes
by two horses. When borne by camels, the head of the hindmost of these
animals is painfully bent down, under the vehicle. It is the most comfortable kind of
litter; and two light persons may travel in it. The name generally given to it is
"takhtaraw&aacute;n," or "takht-raw&aacute;n;" but the term employed in the passage to which
this note refers is "mi&#7717;affeh," which is often used as a general name for a camel-litter,
and particularly applied to one with a flat top.&mdash;A very common kind of camel-litter,
called "musa&#7789;&#7789;a&#7717;," or "&#7717;eml musa&#7789;&#7789;a&#7717;," resembles a small square tent, and is chiefly
composed of two long chests, each of which has a high back: these are placed on the
camel in the same manner as a pair of panniers, one on each side; and the high backs,
which are placed outwards, together with a small pole resting on the camel's pack-saddle,
support the covering which forms what may be called the tent. This vehicle
accommodates two persons. It is generally open at the front; and may also be opened
at the back. Though it appears comfortable, the motion is uneasy; especially when it
is placed upon a camel that has been accustomed to carry heavy burdens: but camels of
easy pace are generally chosen for bearing litters.&mdash;Another kind of litter, called
"shibreeyeh," is composed of a small square platform with an arched covering. This
accommodates but one person; and is placed on the back of the camel: two sa&#7717;&#7717;&aacute;rahs
(or square camel-chests), one on each side of the animal, generally form a foundation
for it.&mdash;The musa&#7789;&#7789;a&#7717; and shibreeyeh (but particularly the latter) are also called
"h&oacute;daj."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII18" id="VIII18">18.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Conversing and Corresponding by means of Signs, Emblems, Metaphors,
&amp;c.</i> Many persons of the instructed classes, and some others, among the Arabs, often
take delight, and shew much ingenuity and quickness of apprehension, in conversing
and corresponding by means of signs, emblems, &amp;c., or in a conventional, metaphorical,
language, not understood by the vulgar in general, and sometimes not by any except
the parties engaged in the intercourse. In some cases, when the main metaphor
employed is understood, the rest of the conversation becomes easily intelligible without
any previous explanation; and I have occasionally succeeded in carrying on a conversation
of this kind (though not in cases such as that described in the tale referred to
by this note); but I have more frequently been unsuccessful in attempting to divine the
nature of a topic in which other persons were engaged. One simple mode of secret
conversation or correspondence is by substituting certain letters for other letters.</p>

<p>Many of the women are said to be adepts in this art, or science, and to convey
messages, declarations of love, &amp;c., by means of fruits, flowers, and other emblems.
The inability of numbers of females in families of the middle classes to write or read, as
well as the difficulty or impossibility frequently existing of conveying written letters,
may have given rise to such modes of communication. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
in one of her charming letters from the East, has gratified our curiosity by a Turkish
love-letter of this kind.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> A specimen of one from an Arab, with its answer, may be
here added.&mdash;An Arab lover sent to his mistress a fan, a bunch of flowers, a silk tassel,
some sugar-candy, and a piece of a chord of a musical instrument; and she returned for
answer a piece of an aloe-plant, three black cumin-seeds, and a piece of a plant used in
washing.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> His communication is thus interpreted:&mdash;The fan, being called "mirwa&#7717;ah,"
a word derived from a root which has among its meanings that of "going to any place
in the evening," signified his wish to pay her an evening visit: the flowers, that the
interview should be in her garden: the tassel, being called "shurr&aacute;beh," that they
should have shar&aacute;b<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> (or wine): the sugar-candy, being termed "sukkar neb&aacute;t," and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>"neb&aacute;t" also signifying "we will pass the night," denoted his desire to remain in her
company until the morning: and the piece of a chord, that they should be entertained
by music. The interpretation of her answer is as follows:&mdash;The piece of an aloe-plant,
which is called "&#7779;abb&aacute;rah" (from "&#7779;abr," which signifies "patience"&mdash;because it will
live for many months together without water), implied that he must wait: the three
black cumin-seeds explained to him that the period of delay should be three nights:
and the plant used in washing informed him that she should then have gone to the
bath, and would meet him.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>&mdash;I have omitted one symbol in the lady's answer, as it
conveys an allusion not so consistent with European as with Arab notions of female
delicacy.</p>

<p>The language of flowers employed by the Turks does not exactly agree with the
system illustrated in the story of 'Azeez and 'Azeezeh; for the former consists of a
collection of words and phrases or sentences which rhyme with the names of the objects
used as the signs.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> This system is also employed by the Arabs; but I believe not so
commonly as the other.</p>

<p>A remarkable faculty is displayed by some Arabs in catching the meaning of secret
signs employed in written communications to them; such signs being often used in
political and other intrigues. The following is a curious instance.&mdash;The celebrated poet
El-Mutanebbee, having written some verses in dispraise of K&aacute;foor El-Ikhsheedee the
independent Governor of Egypt, was obliged to flee, and hide himself in a distant
town. K&aacute;foor was informed of his retreat, and desired his secretary to write to him a
letter promising him pardon, and commanding him to return; but told the writer at
the same time, that when the poet came he would punish him. The secretary was a
friend of the poet, and, being obliged to read the letter to the Prince when he had
written it, was perplexed how to convey to El-Mutanebbee some indication of the
danger that awaited him: he could only venture to do so in the exterior address; and
having written this in the usual form, commencing "In sh&aacute;a-ll&aacute;h" (If it be the will of
God) "this shall arrive," &amp;c., he put a small mark of reduplication over the "n" in the
first word, which he thus converted into "Inna;" the filial vowel being understood.
The poet read the letter, and was rejoiced to see a promise of pardon; but on looking a
second time at the address, was surprised to observe the mark of reduplication over the
"n." Knowing the writer to be his friend, he immediately suspected a secret meaning,
and rightly conceived that the sign conveyed an allusion to a passage in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n
commencing with the word "Inna," and this he divined to be the following:&mdash;"Verily
the magistrates are deliberating concerning thee, to put thee to death."<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> Accordingly,
he fled to another town.&mdash;Some authors add, that he wrote a reply, conveying, by a
similar sign, to his friend, an allusion to another passage in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n:&mdash;"We will
never enter the country while they remain therein."<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a>&mdash;It is probable that signs thus
employed were used by many persons to convey allusions to certain words; and such
may have been the case in the above-mentioned instance: if not, the poet was indeed a
wonderful guesser.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII19" id="VIII19">19.</a></span> Perhaps it is unnecessary to explain that the actions here described are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>those of a dyer, dipping a piece of linen into a red dye, and then wringing it. The
shop of the dyer is generally, like most other shops, a small chamber or recess
open towards the street. Pans containing the different dyes are imbedded in its
floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII20" id="VIII20">20.</a></span> "Ma&#7731;'ad" is a name generally given to a chamber in which male guests
or visiters are received, having an open front with two or more arches, and looking into
the court or garden of the house. Its floor is elevated about ten or more feet above the
ground, and the front is usually towards the north, or nearly so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII21" id="VIII21">21.</a></span> I suppose it to be meant, that these designs were executed in a kind of
mosaic work; for the pool of the fountain is generally ornamented with black and white
marble, and pieces of fine red tile, inlaid in complicated and tasteful patterns. A view
and plan of a fountain of this kind are inserted in the Introduction to my work on the
Modern Egyptians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII22" id="VIII22">22.</a></span> "Ba&#7731;l&aacute;weh," from the Turkish "ba&#7731;l&aacute;va," is a name given to a kind of
pastry, which is generally thus prepared:&mdash;A paste made of fine flour with clarified
butter is rolled thin, and laid upon a tray: upon this paste is then spread a composition
of clarified butter and blanched almonds (and sometimes walnuts and currants) beaten
small; and over this is put another layer of paste. Eight of these double layers of
paste with the composition above mentioned between them are placed one upon another,
making the whole about an inch thick. It is baked in an oven; cut into lozenge-shaped
pieces, about three inches long, and two inches wide; and after it is thus cut,
some honey or treacle is poured over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII23" id="VIII23">23.</a></span> See Note 99 to Chapter v.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII24" id="VIII24">24.</a></span> It is a general belief of the Muslims that the wicked will rise to judgment
with their faces black; and hence the origin of the imprecation, "May God blacken
thy face!" But it is often used to signify "May God disgrace thee!" for a person's
face is said to be black when he is in any disgrace; and in the reverse case, it is said to
be white.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII25" id="VIII25">25.</a></span> "Zardeh" (which is a Persian word) is a name given to rice dressed
with honey and saffron; but here it appears to be applied to a sweet drink infused with
saffron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII26" id="VIII26">26.</a></span> By the play-bone and the &#7789;&aacute;b-stick an allusion is conveyed to two games
common among the Arabs. The play-bones are used in the same manner as dice, of
which they are probably the origin; and both bear the same name in the Arabic, in the
singular "ka&#7841;b" or "ka&#7841;beh," that is, "a cube." Of the game of &#7789;&aacute;b I have given a
full account in my work on the Modern Egyptians (vol. ii. ch. iv.). I need only
mention here, that the &#7789;&aacute;b-stick is of a flat form, about a span (or eight inches) in
length, and two-thirds of an inch in breadth, generally formed of a piece of a palm-branch;
one side of which, being cut flat and smooth, is white; the other, green, or, if
not fresh, of a dull yellow colour. Four such sticks are used in playing the game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII27" id="VIII27">27.</a></span> The more simple interpretation is this:&mdash;Idle games are more suited to
thee than affairs of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII28" id="VIII28">28.</a></span> El-&#7730;azweenee makes a remark somewhat similar to this at the close of
his account of the date; but the interpretation of the meaning conveyed by the date-stone
in our text is very far-fetched: my sheykh, in a marginal note, gives one
perfectly apposite: the date-stone is called "naw&aacute;yeh," and more properly "naw&aacute;h"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>and "naw&agrave;;" and the last of these words signifies also "distance," "absence," &amp;c.,
and is often used to express the state of one who is far from loving or being a lover:
it implies also, in this case, that, if he slept again, she would cast him off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII29" id="VIII29">29.</a></span> The locust-fruit, by its dark colour, and the length of time it remains in
a state of preservation after it has been plucked, is rendered a fit emblem of a heart long
enduring separation from the object of its love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII30" id="VIII30">30.</a></span> "Dirhem," I have before mentioned, is the name of a silver coin: it is
also the name of a weight, very nearly equivalent to forty-eight English grains; and
being here described as of iron, we must understand it in the latter sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII31" id="VIII31">31.</a></span> I suppose the iron dirhem to be symbolic of the eye because it is round,
and perhaps likewise because the Arabic term for "iron" (namely "&#7717;adeed") has also
the signification of "sharp" or "piercing;" in which sense it is often applied to the
sight (as in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, ch. l. v. 21). See the next note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII32" id="VIII32">32.</a></span> From this double oath, it seems to me probable, that, by the circular form
of the dirhem, an allusion was meant to God (as being without beginning or end), and
that the matter of which it was composed (from what I have said in the note immediately
preceding), as well as its form, conveyed the allusion to the eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII33" id="VIII33">33.</a></span> This gentle kneading or pressing of the limbs, which is one of the operations
performed in the bath, is often practised by the Arabs for the purpose of inducing
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII34" id="VIII34">34.</a></span> This is a kind of nebeedh. (See Note 22 to Chapter iii.) The same fruit
is also stewed with meat. It is called in Arabic "'onn&aacute;b."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII35" id="VIII35">35.</a></span> See Note 18 to Chapter vii.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII36" id="VIII36">36.</a></span> It is seen that 'Azeezeh speaks of herself in the masculine gender in the
verses here inserted; but this is in accordance with a common Arab custom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII37" id="VIII37">37.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On the Ceremony called</i> Zikr. Zikrs are very often performed after a
death; the merit of the performance being transferred to the soul of the deceased.</p>

<p>I have before mentioned these ceremonies (in Note 63 to Chapter iii.); but in a vague
manner; and as it is my object in the present work to give such illustrations as will
satisfy the general reader, without obliging him to refer to other books, I shall here
insert an abridged extract, descriptive of a zikr, from my Account of the Manners and
Customs of the Modern Egyptians.</p>

<p>The zikkeers (or performers of the zikr), who were about thirty in number, sat, cross-legged,
upon matting extended close to the houses on one side of the street, in the form
of an oblong ring.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> Within this ring, along the middle of the matting, were placed
three very large wax candles; each about four feet high, and stuck in a low candlestick.
Most of the zikkeers were A&#7717;medee darweeshes, persons of the lower orders, and meanly
dressed: many of them wore green turbans. At one end of the ring were four munshids
(or singers of religious odes), and with them was a player on the kind of flute called
"n&aacute;y." I procured a small seat of palm-sticks from a coffee-shop close by, and, by
means of a little pushing, and the assistance of my servant, obtained a place with the
munshids, and sat there to hear a complete act, or "meglis," of the zikr; which act
commenced at about three o'clock (or three hours after sunset), and continued two
hours.</p>

<p>The performers began by reciting the F&aacute;t'&#7717;ah (or opening chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n) all
together; their sheykh, or chief, first exclaiming, "El-F&aacute;t'&#7717;ah!" They then chanted
the following words;&mdash;"O God, bless our lord Mo&#7717;ammad among the former genera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>tions;
and bless our lord Mo&#7717;ammad among the latter generations; and bless our lord
Mo&#7717;ammad in every time and period; and bless our lord Mo&#7717;ammad in the highest
degree, unto the day of judgment; and bless all the prophets and apostles among the
inhabitants of the heavens and of the earth; and may God (whose name be blessed and
exalted!) be well pleased with our lords and our masters, those persons of illustrious
estimation, Aboo-Bekr and 'Omar and 'Osm&aacute;n and 'Alee, and with all the favourites of
God. God is our sufficiency; and excellent is the Guardian! There is no strength nor
power but in God, the High, the Great! O God! O our Lord! O Thou liberal of pardon!
O Thou most bountiful of the most bountiful! O God! Amen!"&mdash;They were
then silent for three or four minutes; and again recited the F&aacute;t'&#7717;ah; but silently.
This form of prefacing the zikr is commonly used, by almost all orders of darweeshes in
Egypt.</p>

<p>The performers now commenced the zikr. Sitting in the manner above described,
they chanted, in slow measure, "L&aacute; il&aacute;ha illa-ll&aacute;h" ("There is no deity but God") to
the following air:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="music" id="music"></a><img src="images/music.png" width="550" height="157" alt="Music" title="Music" /></div>

<p>bowing the head and body twice in each repetition of "L&aacute; il&aacute;ha illa-ll&aacute;h." Thus they
continued about a quarter of an hour; and then, for about the same space of time, they
repeated the same words to the same air, but in a quicker measure, and with correspondingly
quicker motions. In the meantime, the munshids frequently sang, to the same,
or a variation of the same, air, portions of a &#7731;a&#7779;eedeh, or of a muweshsha&#7717;; an ode of a
similar nature to the Song of Solomon, generally alluding to the Prophet as the object
of love and praise; and at frequent intervals, one of them sang out the word "meded,"
implying an invocation for spiritual or supernatural aid.</p>

<p>The zikkeers, after having performed as above described, next repeated the same
words to a different air for about the same length of time; first, very slowly; then,
quickly. The air was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="music2" id="music2"></a><img src="images/music2.png" width="550" height="148" alt="Music" title="Music" /></div>

<p>Then they repeated these words again, to the following air, in the same manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px; position: relative;"><a name="fmusic3" id="fmusic3"></a><img src="images/music3.png" width="550" height="83" alt="Music" title="Music" /></div>

<p>They next rose, and, standing in the same order in which they had been sitting,
repeated the same words to another air. After which, still standing, they repeated
these words in a very deep and hoarse tone; laying the principal emphasis upon the
word "L&aacute;" and the first syllable of the last word "Allah;" and uttering it, apparently,
with a considerable effort: the sound much resembled that which is produced by beating
the rim of a tambourine. Each zikkeer turned his head alternately to the right
and left at each repetition of "L&aacute; il&aacute;ha illa-ll&aacute;h." One of them, a eunuch, at this part
of the zikr, was seized with an epileptic fit, evidently the result of a high state of
religious excitement; but nobody seemed surprised at it; for occurrences of this kind
at zikrs are not uncommon. All the performers now seemed much excited; repeating
their ejaculations with greater rapidity, violently turning their heads, and sinking the
whole body at the same time: some of them jumping. The eunuch above mentioned
again was seized with fits several times; and I generally remarked that this happened
after one of the munshids had sung a line or two and exerted himself more than usually
to excite his hearers: the singing was, indeed, to my taste, very pleasing. The contrast
presented by the vehement and distressing exertions of the performers at the close of
the zikr, and their calm gravity and solemnity of manner at the commencement, was
particularly striking. Money was collected during the performance for the munshids.
The zikkeers receive no pay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII38" id="VIII38">38.</a></span> From the last of these verses it appears that the flowers are described as
<i>laid</i> upon the tomb (in accordance with the custom mentioned in the last paragraph of
Note 16 to Chapter i.), and not as <i>planted</i> upon it; though this is frequently done in
some countries of the East; the monument being filled with mould, and the whole of
its top open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII41" id="VIII41">41.</a></span> The "rod" (in Arabic "&#7731;a&#7779;abeh") was, according to the Egyptian
measurement, until lately reduced, about twelve English feet and a half.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII42" id="VIII42">42.</a></span> See Note 12 to Chapter iii.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII43" id="VIII43">43.</a></span> It is common (as my sheykh has remarked) to say, of a very spacious
chamber, that a horseman might gallop in it. The playing at goff by horsemen has
been mentioned in a former tale. It was a common exercise in Egypt as well as Persia
and other Eastern countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII44" id="VIII44">44.</a></span> "Deleeleh" is an epithet used in modern Arabic as indicative of artifice,
machination, or fraud.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> It is often employed as a female nickname.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII45" id="VIII45">45.</a></span> From this point to the end of the story of 'Azeez and 'Azeezeh I omit
some portions which are tedious, and others which are more objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII46" id="VIII46">46.</a></span> Any one may enter the public bath, but none can go out of it, without

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII47" id="VIII47">47.</a></span> The "ka&#7841;k," commonly called "ka&#7717;k," has been described in Note 16 to
Chapter i. De Sacy has remarked that our English word "cake" seems to be from the
same origin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII48" id="VIII48">48.</a></span>&mdash;<i>On Oaths.</i> To explain this passage, I must repeat, with a few slight
additions, some remarks which I have made in a former publication.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a>&mdash;Among a people
by whom falsehood, in certain cases, is not only allowed but commended,<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> oaths of
different kinds are more or less binding. In considering this subject, we should also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>remember that oaths may sometimes be expiated.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> There are some oaths which, I
believe, few Muslims would falsely take; such as saying, three times, "By God the
Great!" (Wa-ll&aacute;hi-l-A&#7827;eem), and the oath upon the mu&#7779;-&#7717;af (or copy of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n),
saying, "By what this contains of the word of God!" This latter is rendered more
binding by placing a sword with the sacred volume; and still more so, by the addition
of a cake, or piece, of bread, and a handful of salt. But a form of oath which is
generally yet more to be depended upon is that of saying, "I impose upon myself divorcement!"
(that is, "the divorce of my wife, if what I say be false"); or, "I impose
upon myself interdiction!" which has a similar meaning ("My wife be unlawful to
me!"); or, "I impose upon myself a triple divorcement!" which binds a man by the
irrevocable divorce of his wife. If a man use any of these three forms of oath falsely,
his wife, if he have but one, is divorced by the oath itself, if proved to be false,
without the absolute necessity of any further ceremony; and if he have two or more
wives, he must, under such circumstances, choose one of them to put away.</p>

<p>In the case which this note is principally intended to illustrate, the wife of 'Azeez
makes him swear by the sword and the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n in the hope of inducing him to return
to her; and by the oath of divorce, to make the inducement more strong, and that she
might be enabled, in case he did not fulfil his vow, legally to contract another marriage
as soon as she should have waited the period which the law requires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII49" id="VIII49">49.</a></span> The verses I have omitted as they are the same (with the exception of
some slight variations) as the first, second, third, and fifth, of those commencing at
page 185 in this volume; and the contents of the accompanying paper as being tiresome
and in some parts unmeaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII50" id="VIII50">50.</a></span> See the first note in the present series.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII51" id="VIII51">51.</a></span> I have substituted "Sh&aacute;h-Zem&aacute;n" (signifying "King of the Age") for
Shahram&aacute;n; the latter being evidently a mistake of a copyist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII52" id="VIII52">52.</a></span> "Duny&agrave;" signifies the "world."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII53" id="VIII53">53.</a></span> "Ri&#7693;w&aacute;n," which signifies "approbation," "complacency," &amp;c., is the
name of the Guardian of Paradise.&mdash;The meaning of this passage is, "Surely this handsome
young person is one of the Wild&aacute;n, or Weleeds, those beautiful youths prepared
to wait upon the faithful in Paradise; and he hath escaped thence through the inadvertence
of Ri&#7693;w&aacute;n." The very meanest in Paradise is promised eighty thousand
of these servants, besides seventy-two &#7716;ooreeyehs, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII54" id="VIII54">54.</a></span> A compliment of this kind is generally uttered on letting a shop or
house, and on selling an article of dress, &amp;c.; and "God bless thee!" is usually said in
reply. In like manner, a merchant selling goods to be re-sold says, "May God grant
thee a profit upon them!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII55" id="VIII55">55.</a></span> The word thus translated signifies taking a morning-draught of wine,
milk, sherbet, or any other beverage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII56" id="VIII56">56.</a></span> When Zeleekh&agrave; invited her female friends that they might behold
Yoosuf (or Joseph) and excuse her for inclining to him, at the sight of him they cut
their own hands, and praised God, ejaculating these words, "This is not a mortal," &amp;c.
(&#7730;ur-&aacute;n, ch. xii. v. 31).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII57" id="VIII57">57.</a></span> To persons more or less above him in rank, the shopkeeper rises and
stands, or merely makes a slight motion as if he were about to rise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII58" id="VIII58">58.</a></span> This is a common invocation, for the protection of a person from envy, or
the evil eye, founded upon the last chapter but one of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, in which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>believer is desired to "seek refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak" from various evils,
and among these "from the mischief of the envious." It is very often said to imply
admiration of a child, that the mother may not fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII59" id="VIII59">59.</a></span> This ejaculation is addressed to God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII60" id="VIII60">60.</a></span> This alludes to one of the stages of the creation of man explained in the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n, ch. xxii. v. 5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII61" id="VIII61">61.</a></span> The old woman is described as being "full of joy" because, having
induced her mistress to answer the letter, she saw a prospect of continuing the correspondence,
and so obtaining additional presents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII62" id="VIII62">62.</a></span> "Es-Suh&agrave;" is an obscure star in the Greater Bear, at which people
look to try their powers of sight. It is the star 80, by [Greek: z]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII63" id="VIII63">63.</a></span> My sheykh has remarked in a marginal note on the "Five Elders" or
Sheykhs here mentioned, "the known number is the four; namely the [first four]
Khaleefehs; or the Four Welees (eminent saints), the seyyid El-Bedawee and the
seyyid Ed-Dasoo&#7731;ee and Er-Rif&aacute;'ee and El-Geel&aacute;nee" The latter four are often
mentioned together as being the saints generally most esteemed in the present day
and the founders of the four principal orders of Darweeshes.&mdash;Who, then, can be
meant by "the Five Elders" I do not know; but I have retained this number as it
occurs again in a variation of the same verses in a subsequent tale, which is almost
exactly the same as that of T&aacute;j-el-Mulook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII64" id="VIII64">64.</a></span> "Ibn-Seen&agrave;" ("Son of Seen&agrave;") is the true name of the great physician
called by us "Avicenna."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII65" id="VIII65">65.</a></span> The gait of Arab ladies is very remarkable: they incline the lower part
of the body from side to side as they step, and with the hands raised to the level of the
bosom they hold the edges of their outer covering. Their pace is slow, and they look
not about them, but keep their eyes towards the ground in the direction to which they
are going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII66" id="VIII66">66.</a></span> It should be remarked here, that the private room of an Eastern princess
is not to be regarded as a Western bed-room. In the East, a guest may lay himself
down upon a deew&aacute;n in the presence of another, to pass the night, without any infringement
of decorum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII67" id="VIII67">67.</a></span> See the latter paragraph of the first note in the present series.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII68" id="VIII68">68.</a></span> See Note 9 to Chapter vii.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII69" id="VIII69">69.</a></span> The doors in Eastern houses generally turn on two wooden pins;
one fitting into a hole in the lintel; the other, into a hole immediately behind the
threshold; and the latter is very short. It is therefore often easy to displace a door
by raising it a little, which may be done by means of a projecting wooden lock; and in
many cases, when the door cannot be displaced from its sockets, it may be raised sufficiently
to remove the inner latch from its catch. The doors of the ancient temples
and tombs in Egypt were formed as above described, with pins, which were often made
of bronze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII70" id="VIII70">70.</a></span> I here read "nimsheh" (also written "nimjeh" and "nimj&aacute;h"&mdash;from
the Persian "neemjah") instead of "&#7731;amsheh." The latter is described by my
sheykh, in a marginal note, as "a strip of leather divided into two, and tied together
and nailed at the upper end to a piece of wood;" but the use of such an instrument in
this case would be ridiculous. The name of "nimsheh" is often given to a royal
dagger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note <a name="VIII71" id="VIII71">71.</a></span> As persons are often decapitated in an Eastern palace, a skin is made
use of to receive the head and the blood. I believe it to be similar to the round skin
used by travellers to eat upon; which is converted into a bag by means of a running
string round the edge.</p>

<p>In concluding the present series of notes, I may state my opinion, that the two
stories to which they relate are fully worthy of insertion in this collection, as extending
the picture of <i>Arab</i> life and manners, whatever may be thought of their <i>origin</i>.</p>

founded by El-Mahdee in Western Africa, in the
year of the Flight 297. His third successor,
El-Mo'ezz li-deeni-ll&aacute;h, conquered Egypt in the
year 358, and the seat of his government was
transferred to Cairo. As they claimed descent
from F&aacute;&#7789;imeh, and were of the Shiya'ee sect, their
possession of the fairest province of the orthodox
(or 'Abb&aacute;see) Khaleefehs forms a strange episode
in the history of El-Isl&aacute;m.&mdash;Their power was overthrown

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
